	abstract = {Abstract
            Water temperature, ice cover, and lake stratification are important physical properties of lakes and reservoirs that control mixing as well as bio-geo-chemical processes and thus influence the water quality. We used an ensemble of vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake models driven with regional climate projections to calculate water temperature, stratification, and ice cover under the A1B emission scenario for the German drinking water reservoir Lichtenberg. We used an analysis of variance method to estimate the contributions of the considered sources of uncertainty on the ensemble output. For all simulated variables, epistemic uncertainty, which is related to the model structure, is the dominant source throughout the simulation period. Nonetheless, the calculated trends are coherent among the five models and in line with historical observations. The ensemble predicts an increase in surface water temperature of 0.34 K per decade, a lengthening of the summer stratification of 3.2 days per decade, as well as decreased probabilities of the occurrence of ice cover and winter inverse stratification by 2100. These expected changes are likely to influence the water quality of the reservoir. Similar trends are to be expected in other reservoirs and lakes in comparable regions.},

	abstract = {Ice-covered waterbodies are far from being quiescent systems. In this paper, we investigate ice-covered freshwater basins heated by solar radiation that penetrates across waters with temperatures below or near the temperature of maximum density. In this scenario, solar radiation sets a radiative buoyancy flux, \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6F7\}\_\{r\}\$, that forces increments of temperature/density in the upper fluid volume, which can become gravitationally unstable and drive convection. The goal of this study is twofold. We first focus on formulating the mechanical energy budget, putting emphasis on the conversion of \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6F7\}\_\{r\}\$ to available potential energy, \$E\_\{a\}\$. We find that \$E\_\{a\}\$ results from a competition among \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6F7\}\_\{r\}\$ and the irreversible mixing controlled by the diapycnal and the laminar mixing rates, respectively. Secondly, and based on the above result, we introduce an integral formulation of the mixing efficiency to quantify the rate of mixing over the relevant time scale \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D70F\}\$, \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x0394\}E\_\{b,{\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D70F\}\}/E\_\{r,{\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D70F\}\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x0394\}E\_\{b,{\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D70F\}\}\$ and \$E\_\{r,{\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D70F\}\}\$ are the change of background potential energy and the time-integrated \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6F7\}\_\{r\}\$ over \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D70F\}\$. The above definition is applied to estimate \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}\$ for the first time, finding an approximate value of \${\textbackslash}unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.65\$. This result suggests that radiatively heated ice-covered waterbodies might be subject to high mixing rates. Overall, the present work provides a framework to examine energetics and mixing in ice-covered waters.},

We review the present advances in understanding the governing physical processes in seasonally ice-covered lakes. Emphasis is placed on the general description of the main physical mechanisms that distinguish the ice-covered season from open water conditions. Physical properties of both ice cover and ice-covered water column are considered. For the former, growth and decay of the seasonal ice, its structure, mechanical and optical properties are discussed. The latter subject deals with circulation and mixing under ice. The relative contribution of the two major circulation drivers, namely heat release from sediment and solar heating, is used for classifying the typical circulation and mixing patterns under ice. In order to provide a physical basis for lake ice phenology, the heat transfer processes related to formation and melting of the seasonal ice cover are discussed in a separate section. Since the ice-covered period in lakes remains poorly investigated to date, this review aims at elaborating an effective strategy for future research based on modern field and modeling methods.},

This framework, termed physics-guided neural networks (PGNN), leverages the output of physics-based model simulations along with observational features in a hybrid modeling setup to generate predictions using a neural network architecture. Further, this framework uses physics-based loss functions in the learning objective of neural networks to ensure that the model predictions not only show lower errors on the training set but are also scientifically consistent with the known physics on the unlabeled set. We illustrate the effectiveness of PGNN for the problem of lake temperature modeling, where physical relationships between the temperature, density, and depth of water are used to design a physics-based loss function. By using scientific knowledge to guide the construction and learning of neural networks, we are able to show that the proposed framework ensures better generalizability as well as scientific consistency of results.

We paired a 20 y freshwater microbial community time series with zooplankton and phytoplankton counts, rich environmental data, and a 6 y cyanotoxin time series. We observed strong microbial phenological patterns that were disrupted by the invasions of spiny water flea ( 
              Bythotrephes cederströmii 
              ) and zebra mussels ( 
              Dreissena polymorpha 
              ). First, we detected shifts in 
              Cyanobacteria 
              phenology. After the spiny water flea invasion, 
              Cyanobacteria 
              dominance crept earlier into clearwater; and after the zebra mussel invasion, 
              Cyanobacteria 
              abundance crept even earlier into the diatom-dominated spring. During summer, the spiny water flea invasion sparked a cascade of shifting diversity where zooplankton diversity decreased and 
              Cyanobacteria 
              diversity increased. Second, we detected shifts in cyanotoxin phenology. After the zebra mussel invasion, microcystin increased in early summer and the duration of toxin production increased by over a month. Third, we observed shifts in heterotrophic bacteria phenology. The 
              Bacteroidota 
              phylum and members of the acI 
              Nanopelagicales 
              lineage were differentially more abundant. The proportion of the bacterial community that changed differed by season; spring and clearwater communities changed most following the spiny water flea invasion that lessened clearwater intensity, while summer communities changed least following the zebra mussel invasion despite the shifts in 
              Cyanobacteria 
              diversity and toxicity. A modeling framework identified the invasions as primary drivers of the observed phenological changes. These long-term invasion-mediated shifts in microbial phenology demonstrate the interconnectedness of microbes with the broader food web and their susceptibility to long-term environmental change.},

	abstract = {Lakes might be sentinels of climate change, but the uncertainty in their main feedback to the atmosphere – heat-exchange fluxes – is often not considered within climate models. Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (Kd). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue – different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results – the answer to the question was unequivocal: Kd, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which Kd is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of Kd could reduce modeling uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Four limnocorrals (8 m dia. by 15 m deep) located at Lake St. George, Ontario, Canada; were used to examine the interactions between planktivorous fish, crustacean zooplankton (notably Daphnia galeata mendotae), and phytoplankton. During the spring, in all of the limnocorrals, high Daphnia biomasses were correlated with increased water transparency and a spring ‘clear-water’ phase. However, as the summer progressed, the relationship between Daphnia biomass and phytoplankton abundance became more complex and less predictable. Investigation of these interactions suggested four conclusions. (1) During late July and throughout August and September, water transparency decreased and algal cell counts increased. In 3 of 4 limnocorrals, deterioration in water quality occurred 3–5 weeks before zooplankton (and Daphnia populations) declined. In all cases decreased transparency was associated with increased concentrations of algal cells (Gloeococcus) that were poor food sources for Daphnia. These results suggested that decreased water transparency was not ‘caused by’ decreases in Daphnia biomass. (2) Taken together, data from all of the limnocorrals showed no correlation between the magnitude of July Daphnia biomasses and the percentage of ‘poor food source’ algae that were observed in August. This suggested that grazer effects were not necessary for the onset of summer ‘poor food source’ algal blooms. (3) In two limnocorrals, there was a positive correlation between increased Daphnia mortality and the onset of ‘poor food source’ blooms. In the other two limnocorrals there was no correlation. In all limnocorrals there was no correlation between decreased Daphnia reproductive capacity and ‘poor food source’ blooms. These data suggested that blooms of ‘poor food source’ algae were not necessary for the collapse of Daphnia populations. (4) In all 4 limnocorrals there was a strong correlation between the time that 0+ yellow perch planktivores reached biomasses of 30–50 kg ha−1 and the collapse of Daphnia populations Species and size selection was also observed. These results suggested that for this set of limnocorral experiments, fish biomasses in the 30–50 kg ha−1 were responsible for the collapse of Daphnia populations in the summer.},

	abstract = {The freshwater–marine transition that characterizes an estuarine system can provide multiple entry options for invading species, yet the relative importance of this gradient in determining the functional contribution of invading species has received little attention. The ecological consequences of species invasion are routinely evaluated within a freshwater versus marine context, even though many invasive species can inhabit a wide range of salinities. We investigate the functional consequences of different sizes of Corbicula fluminea—an invasive species able to adapt to a wide range of temperatures and salinity—across the freshwater–marine transition in the presence versus absence of warming. Specifically, we characterize how C. fluminea affect fluid and particle transport, important processes in mediating nutrient cycling (NH
4‐N, NO
3‐N, PO
4‐P). Results showed that sediment particle reworking (bioturbation) tends to be influenced by size and to a lesser extent, temperature and salinity; nutrient concentrations are influenced by different interactions between all variables (salinity, temperature, and size class). Our findings demonstrate the highly context‐dependent nature of the ecosystem consequences of invasion and highlight the potential for species to simultaneously occupy multiple components of an ecosystem. Recognizing of this aspect of invasibility is fundamental to management and conservation efforts, particularly as freshwater and marine systems tend to be compartmentalized rather than be treated as a contiguous unit. We conclude that more comprehensive appreciation of the distribution of invasive species across adjacent habitats and different seasons is urgently needed to allow the true extent of biological introductions, and their ecological consequences, to be fully realized.},

              Homo sapiens 
              . A crucial outcome of such behaviors has been the dramatic reshaping of the global biosphere, a transformation whose early origins are increasingly apparent from cumulative archaeological and paleoecological datasets. Such data suggest that, by the Late Pleistocene, humans had begun to engage in activities that have led to alterations in the distributions of a vast array of species across most, if not all, taxonomic groups. Changes to biodiversity have included extinctions, extirpations, and shifts in species composition, diversity, and community structure. We outline key examples of these changes, highlighting findings from the study of new datasets, like ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotopes, and microfossils, as well as the application of new statistical and computational methods to datasets that have accumulated significantly in recent decades. We focus on four major phases that witnessed broad anthropogenic alterations to biodiversity—the Late Pleistocene global human expansion, the Neolithic spread of agriculture, the era of island colonization, and the emergence of early urbanized societies and commercial networks. Archaeological evidence documents millennia of anthropogenic transformations that have created novel ecosystems around the world. This record has implications for ecological and evolutionary research, conservation strategies, and the maintenance of ecosystem services, pointing to a significant need for broader cross-disciplinary engagement between archaeology and the biological and environmental sciences.},

	abstract = {Climate change is asymmetrically altering environmental conditions in space, from local to global scales, creating novel heterogeneity. Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize — or rewire — food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring — a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring — changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web’s interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists’ responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.},

Our study area is focused on the Great Lakes. This coupled model realistically reproduces the lake surface temperature (LST) at a buoy station in a shallow lake (Lake Erie) while generating strong LST biases ranging from −20 to 20 °C at a buoy station in a deep lake (Lake Superior). Through many sensitivity tests, we find that the biases in the deep lake LST simulations result from the drastic underestimation of heat transfer between the lower and upper parts of the lake through unrealistic eddy diffusion. Additional tests were made to calibrate the eddy diffusivity in WRF-Lake. It is found that when this parameter is multiplied by a factor ranging from 102 to 105 for various lake depths deeper than 15 m, the LST simulations for the deep lake buoy station show good agreement with observations, and the bias range reduces to ±4 °C. Essentially, the enlarged eddy diffusivity strengthens heat transfer within the lake columns in the deep lake, which is significantly underestimated in the lake model without calibration. Validation simulations with the calibrated eddy diffusivity were carried out for the whole of Lake Superior and Lake Erie. The LST simulations still have a substantial bias reduction when compared with those produced with the original eddy diffusivity, indicating that the calibrated parameter is representative. In addition, the improved 1-D lake model with WRF reasonably reproduces the remotely sensed LST geographic distribution.},

The annual variation in the net heat flux can be adequately described using a six-term heat balance equation based on 12 years of monthly mean meteorological and surface temperature data. Although the magnitude of the net heat flux is dominated by the radiative terms of the equation, the one-month backward shift of the net flux and total heat content extrema from the solstices and equinoxes respectively is due to the phase shift of the non-radiative with respect to the radiative terms. A linear approximation was used to express the net heat flux in terms of a heat exchange coefficient and an equilibrium temperature. The former varies from 17 to 28 W·m−2·K−1 in the course of a year; fluctuations in the latter are found to depend mainly on fluctuations in cloud cover and relative humidity, whilst the effect of fluctuations in air temperature and wind speed is slight.},

The open source, Fortran-based Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models addresses these problems by providing a consistent set of programming interfaces through which hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models communicate. Models are coded once to connect to FABM, after which arbitrary combinations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models can be made. Thus, a biogeochemical model code works unmodified within models of a chemostat, a vertically structured water column, and a three-dimensional basin. Moreover, complex biogeochemistry can be distributed over many compact, self-contained modules, coupled at run-time. By enabling distributed development and user-controlled coupling of biogeochemical models, FABM enables optimal use of the expertise of scientists, programmers and end-users.},

Then we present a pre-training technique which transfers knowledge from physics-based models to initialize the machine learning model and learn the physics of streamflow and thermodynamics. We also propose a new loss function that balances the performance over different river segments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in predicting temperature and streamflow in a subset of the Delaware River Basin. In particular, we show that the proposed method brings a 33{\textbackslash}\%/14{\textbackslash}\% improvement over the state-of-the-art physics-based model and 24{\textbackslash}\%/14{\textbackslash}\% over traditional machine learning models (e.g., Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network) in temperature/streamflow prediction using very sparse (0.1{\textbackslash}\%) observation data for training. The proposed method has also been shown to produce better performance when generalized to different seasons or river segments with different streamflow ranges.},

	abstract = {Physics-based models are often used to study engineering and environmental systems. The ability to model these systems is the key to achieving our future environmental sustainability and improving the quality of human life. This article focuses on simulating lake water temperature, which is critical for understanding the impact of changing climate on aquatic ecosystems and assisting in aquatic resource management decisions. General Lake Model (GLM) is a state-of-the-art physics-based model used for addressing such problems. However, like other physics-based models used for studying scientific and engineering systems, it has several well-known limitations due to simplified representations of the physical processes being modeled or challenges in selecting appropriate parameters. While state-of-the-art machine learning models can sometimes outperform physics-based models given ample amount of training data, they can produce results that are physically inconsistent. This article proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN) that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and improves the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physics-based models (by over 20\% even with very little training data), while generating outputs consistent with physical laws. An important aspect of our PGRNN approach lies in its ability to incorporate the knowledge encoded in physics-based models. This allows training the PGRNN model using very few true observed data while also ensuring high prediction accuracy. Although we present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines where physics-based (also known as mechanistic) models are used.},

	abstract = {Lake ecosystems, and the organisms that live within them, are vulnerable to temperature change1–5, including the increased occurrence of thermal extremes6. However, very little is known about lake heatwaves—periods of extreme warm lake surface water temperature—and how they may change under global warming. Here we use satellite observations and a numerical model to investigate changes in lake heatwaves for hundreds of lakes worldwide from 1901 to 2099. We show that lake heatwaves will become hotter and longer by the end of the twenty-first century. For the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), the average intensity of lake heatwaves, defined relative to the historical period (1970 to 1999), will increase from 3.7 ± 0.1 to 5.4 ± 0.8 degrees Celsius and their average duration will increase dramatically from 7.7 ± 0.4 to 95.5 ± 35.3 days. In the low-greenhouse-gas-emission RCP 2.6 scenario, heatwave intensity and duration will increase to 4.0 ± 0.2 degrees Celsius and 27.0 ± 7.6 days, respectively. Surface heatwaves are longer-lasting but less intense in deeper lakes (up to 60 metres deep) than in shallower lakes during both historic and future periods. As lakes warm during the twenty-first century7,8, their heatwaves will begin to extend across multiple seasons, with some lakes reaching a permanent heatwave state. Lake heatwaves are likely to exacerbate the adverse effects of long-term warming in lakes and exert widespread influence on their physical structure and chemical properties. Lake heatwaves could alter species composition by pushing aquatic species and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience. This in turn could threaten lake biodiversity9 and the key ecological and economic benefits that lakes provide to society.},

Yet historical simulations have not been used to formally attribute changes in lake ice and temperature to anthropogenic drivers. In addition, future projections of these properties are limited to individual lakes or global simulations from single lake models. Here we uncover the human imprint on lakes worldwide using hindcasts and projections from five lake models. Reanalysed trends in lake temperature and ice cover in recent decades are extremely unlikely to be explained by pre-industrial climate variability alone. Ice-cover trends in reanalysis are consistent with lake model simulations under historical conditions, providing attribution of lake changes to anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, lake temperature, ice thickness and duration scale robustly with global mean air temperature across future climate scenarios (+0.9 °C °Cair–1, –0.033 m °Cair–1 and –9.7 d °Cair–1, respectively). These impacts would profoundly alter the functioning of lake ecosystems and the services they provide.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Empirical evidence demonstrates that lakes and reservoirs are warming across
the globe. Consequently, there is an increased need to project future
changes in lake thermal structure and resulting changes in lake
biogeochemistry in order to plan for the likely impacts. Previous studies of
the impacts of climate change on lakes have often relied on a single model
forced with limited scenario-driven projections of future climate for a
relatively small number of lakes. As a result, our understanding of the
effects of climate change on lakes is fragmentary, based on scattered
studies using different data sources and modelling protocols, and mainly
focused on individual lakes or lake regions. This has precluded
identification of the main impacts of climate change on lakes at global and
regional scales and has likely contributed to the lack of lake water quality
considerations in policy-relevant documents, such as the Assessment Reports
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Here, we describe a
simulation protocol developed by the Lake Sector of the Inter-Sectoral
Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) for simulating climate change
impacts on lakes using an ensemble of lake models and climate change
scenarios for ISIMIP phases 2 and 3. The protocol prescribes lake
simulations driven by climate forcing from gridded observations and
different Earth system models under various representative greenhouse gas
concentration pathways (RCPs), all consistently bias-corrected on a
0.5∘ × 0.5∘ global grid. In ISIMIP phase 2, 11 lake
models were forced with these data to project the thermal structure of 62
well-studied lakes where data were available for calibration under
historical conditions, and using uncalibrated models for 17 500 lakes
defined for all global grid cells containing lakes. In ISIMIP phase 3, this
approach was expanded to consider more lakes, more models, and more
processes. The ISIMIP Lake Sector is the largest international effort to
project future water temperature, thermal structure, and ice phenology of
lakes at local and global scales and paves the way for future simulations of
the impacts of climate change on water quality and biogeochemistry in lakes.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..1812356G},
	abstract = {Coastal aquifer systems are used intensively to meet the growing demands for water in those regions. They are especially at risk for the intrusion of seawater due to aquifer overpumping, limited groundwater replenishment and unsustainable groundwater management which in turn also impacts the social and economical development of coastal regions. One example is the Al-Batinah coastal plain in northern Oman where irrigated agriculture is practiced by lots of small scaled farms in different distances from the sea, each of them pumping their water from coastal aquifer. Due to continuous overpumping and progressing saltwater intrusion farms near the coast had to close since water for irrigation got too saline. For investigating appropriate management options numerical density dependent groundwater modelling is required which should also portray the adaption of groundwater abstraction schemes on the water quality. For addressing this challenge a moving inner boundary condition is implemented in the numerical density dependent groundwater model which adjusts the locations for groundwater abstraction according to the position of the seawater intrusion front controlled by thresholds of relative chloride concentration. The adaption process is repeated for each management cycle within transient model simulations and allows for considering feedbacks with the consumers e.g. the agriculture by moving agricultural farms more inland or towards the sea if more fertile soils at the coast could be recovered. For finding optimal water management strategies efficiently, the behaviour of the numerical groundwater model for different extraction and replenishment scenarios is approximated by an artificial neural network using a novel approach for state space surrogate model development. Afterwards the derived surrogate is coupled with an agriculture module within a simulation based water management optimisation framework to achieve optimal cropping pattern and water abstraction schemes regarding multiple objectives like aquifer sustainability and profitable agriculture. Results obtained for the above mentioned region show that the surrogate model has a very good interpolation capability i.e. it is able to reproduce unknown states obtained by numerical model simulations within the range of its training data. Furthermore, the importance of portraying the adaptive behaviour of farmers on water quality is underlined to develop management scenarios more realistically. However, results of a stop pumping scenario show that it is not possible to push back an advanced seawater intrusion in a time period of 200 years. Therefore, combinations of technical and adaptive measures are required.},

Simulations for Lake Erie suggest that the observed toxigenic-to-nontoxigenic strain succession during the 2014 Toledo drinking water crisis was controlled by different cellular oxidative stress mitigation strategies (protection by microcystin versus degradation by enzymes) and the different susceptibility of those mechanisms to nitrogen limitation. This model, as well as a simpler empirical one, predicts that the planned phosphorus load reduction will lower biomass but make nitrogen and light more available, which will increase toxin production, favor toxigenic cells, and increase toxin concentrations.

              Lake Erie receives water from important agricultural areas of Canada and the United States and is subject to high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff. These nutrients can lead to rapid growth of photosynthetic organisms, some of which produce toxins that harm aquatic animals and compromise drinking water. Recent efforts have focused on reducing phosphorus loading. With support from a large literature meta-analysis, Hellweger 
              et al 
              . developed an agent-based model of cyanobacterial metabolism to determine how toxin production changed under a range of nutrient and environmental conditions and defined the associated molecular mechanisms (see the Perspective by Ofiţeru and Picioreanu). They found that phosphorus reduction alone was potentially harmful, lowering total biomass but increasing toxin production. The proposed mechanism involves response to hydrogen peroxide stress and increased light transmission. —MAF

	abstract = {Abstract. Numerical models are an important tool for simulating
temperature, hydrodynamics, and water quality in lakes and reservoirs.
Existing models differ in dimensionality by considering spatial variations
of simulated parameters (e.g., flow velocity and water temperature) in one
(1D), two (2D) or three (3D) spatial dimensions. The different approaches
are based on different levels of simplification in the description of
hydrodynamic processes and result in different demands on computational
power. The aim of this study is to compare three models with different
dimensionalities and to analyze differences between model results in relation
to model simplifications. We analyze simulations of thermal stratification,
flow velocity and substance transport by density currents in a medium-sized
drinking-water reservoir in the subtropical zone, using three widely used
open-source models: GLM (1D), CE-QUAL-W2 (2D) and Delft3D (3D). The models
were operated with identical initial and boundary conditions over a 1-year
period. Their performance was assessed by comparing model results with
measurements of temperature, flow velocity and turbulence. Our results show
that all models were capable of simulating the seasonal changes in water
temperature and stratification. Flow velocities, only available for the 2D
and 3D approaches, were more challenging to reproduce, but 3D simulations
showed closer agreement with observations. With increasing dimensionality,
the quality of the simulations also increased in terms of error, correlation
and variance. None of the models provided good agreement with observations
in terms of mixed layer depth, which also affects the spreading of inflowing
water as density currents and the results of water quality models that
build on outputs of the hydrodynamic models.},

            Species invasions are a leading threat to ecosystems globally, but our understanding of interactions among multiple invasive species and their outcomes on ecosystem properties is undeveloped despite their significance to conservation and management. Here we studied a large lake in Minnesota, USA, that experienced a simultaneous surge in invasive zebra mussel and spiny water flea populations. A long-term (2000–2018) dataset offered a rare opportunity to assess whole-ecosystem shifts following the co-invasion. Within two years, the native crustacean zooplankton community declined abruptly in density and productivity (−93\% and −91\%, respectively). Summer phytoplankton abundance and water clarity remained stable across the time series, an unexpected outcome given the high density of zebra mussels in the lake. Observational data and modeling indicate that removal of native herbivorous zooplankton by the predatory spiny water flea reduced zooplankton grazing pressure enough to compensate new grazing losses due to zebra mussels, resulting in a zero net effect on phytoplankton abundance and water clarity despite a wholesale shift in secondary production from the pelagic to the benthic food web. This study reveals the extent of direct and indirect effects of two aquatic invaders on food-web processes that cancel shifts in water clarity, a highly valued ecosystem service.},

            The ecosystems of the Laurentian Great Lakes have been dramatically reengineered by invasive bottom-dwelling dreissenid mussels. A key question is whether this biological change has altered whole-ecosystem biogeochemistry, in particular the cycling of phosphorus, a key nutrient that limits biological productivity in freshwater ecosystems. We show that phosphorus cycling in the invaded Great Lakes is now regulated by the population dynamics of a single benthic species, the quagga mussel. This qualitatively changes the responses of the affected lakes to phosphorus inputs from watersheds, complicates predictions, and necessitates a new paradigm for managing these large aquatic ecosystems. Similar changes likely play out in many other dreissenid-invaded lakes across Europe and North America.
          , 
            The productivity of aquatic ecosystems depends on the supply of limiting nutrients. The invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes, the world’s largest freshwater ecosystem, by dreissenid (zebra and quagga) mussels has dramatically altered the ecology of these lakes. A key open question is how dreissenids affect the cycling of phosphorus (P), the nutrient that limits productivity in the Great Lakes. We show that a single species, the quagga mussel, is now the primary regulator of P cycling in the lower four Great Lakes. By virtue of their enormous biomass, quagga mussels sequester large quantities of P in their tissues and dramatically intensify benthic P exchanges. Mass balance analysis reveals a previously unrecognized sensitivity of the Great Lakes ecosystem, where P availability is now regulated by the dynamics of mussel populations while the role of the external inputs of phosphorus is suppressed. Our results show that a single invasive species can have dramatic consequences for geochemical cycles even in the world’s largest aquatic ecosystems. The ongoing spread of dreissenids across a multitude of lakes in North America and Europe is likely to affect carbon and nutrient cycling in these systems for many decades, with important implications for water quality management.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have long studied patterns, directions and tempos of change, but there is a pressing need to extend current understanding to empirical observations of abrupt changes as climate warming accelerates. Abrupt changes in ecological systems (ACES)—changes that are fast in time or fast relative to their drivers—are ubiquitous and increasing in frequency. Powerful theoretical frameworks exist, yet applications in real-world landscapes to detect, explain and anticipate ACES have lagged. We highlight five insights emerging from empirical studies of ACES across diverse ecosystems: (i) ecological systems show ACES in some dimensions but not others; (ii) climate extremes may be more important than mean climate in generating ACES; (iii) interactions among multiple drivers often produce ACES; (iv) contingencies, such as ecological memory, frequency and sequence of disturbances, and spatial context are important; and (v) tipping points are often (but not always) associated with ACES. We suggest research priorities to advance understanding of ACES in the face of climate change. Progress in understanding ACES requires strong integration of scientific approaches (theory, observations, experiments and process-based models) and high-quality empirical data drawn from a diverse array of ecosystems.

	abstract = {Introductions or invasions of nonnative organisms can mediate major changes in the trophic structure of aquatic ecosystems. Here we document multitrophic level impacts in a spatially extensive system that played out over more than a century. Positive interactions among exotic vertebrate and invertebrate predators caused a substantial and abrupt shift in community composition resulting in a trophic cascade that extended to primary producers and to a nonaquatic species, the bald eagle. The opossum shrimp,
              Mysis diluviana
              , invaded Flathead Lake, Montana, the largest freshwater lake in the western United States. Lake trout had been introduced 80 y prior but remained at low densities until nonnative
              Mysis
              became established. The bottom-dwelling mysids eliminated a recruitment bottleneck for lake trout by providing a deep water source of food where little was available previously. Lake trout subsequently flourished on mysids and this voracious piscivore now dominates the lake fishery; formerly abundant kokanee were extirpated, and native bull and westslope cutthroat trout are imperiled. Predation by
              Mysis
              shifted zooplankton and phytoplankton community size structure. Bayesian change point analysis of primary productivity (27-y time series) showed a significant step increase of 55 mg C m

              d
              −1
              (i.e., 21\% rise) concurrent with the mysid invasion, but little trend before or after despite increasing nutrient loading.
              Mysis
              facilitated predation by lake trout and indirectly caused the collapse of kokanee, redirecting energy flow through the ecosystem that would otherwise have been available to other top predators (bald eagles).},

	abstract = {Zooplankton samples for the 4 southern Wisconsin LTER lakes (Mendota, Monona, Wingra, Fish) have been collected for analysis by LTER since 1995 (1996 Wingra, Fish) when the southern Wisconsin lakes were added to the North Temperate Lakes LTER project. Samples are collected as a vertical tow using an 80-micron mesh conical net with a 30-cm diameter opening (net mouth: net length ratio = 1:3) consistent with sampling conducted by the Wisconsin Dept. Natural Resources in prior years. Zooplankton tows are taken in the deep hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling; zooplankton samples are preserved in 70\% ethanol for later processing. Samples are usually collected with standard tow depths on most dates (e.g., 20 meters for Lake Mendota) but not always, so tow depth is recorded as a variate in the database. Crustacean species are identified and counted for Mendota and Monona and body lengths are recorded for a portion of each species identified (see data protocol for counting procedure); samples for Wingra and Fish lakes are archived but not routinely counted. Numerical densities for Mendota and Monona zooplankton samples are reported in the database as number or organisms per square meter without correcting for net efficiency. [Net efficiency varies from a maximum of about 70\% under clear water conditions; net efficiency declines when algal blooms are dense (Lathrop, R.C. 1998. Water clarity responses to phosphorus and Daphnia in Lake Mendota. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison.)] Organism densities in number per cubic meter can be obtained by dividing the reported square-meter density by the tow depth, although adjustments for the oxygenated depth zone during the summer and early fall stratified season is required to obtain realistic zooplankton volumetric densities in the lake's surface waters. Biomass densities can be calculated using literature formulas for converting organism body lengths reported in the database to body masses. Sampling Frequency: bi-weekly during ice-free season from late March or early April through early September, then every 4 weeks through late November; sampling is conducted usually once during the winter (depending on ice conditions). Number of sites: 4 Note: for a period between approximately 2011 and 2015, a calculation error caused density values to be significantly greater than they should have been for the entire dataset. That issue has been corrected.},

Samples are collected as a composite whole-water sample and are preserved in gluteraldehyde. Composite sample depths are 0-8 meters for Lake Mendota (to conform to samples collected and analyzed since 1990 for a UW/DNR food web research study), and 0-2 meters for the other three lakes. A tube sampler is used for the 0-8 m Lake Mendota samples; samples for the other lakes are obtained by collecting water at 1-meter intervals using a Kemmerer water sampler and compositing the samples in a bucket. Samples are taken in the deep hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling. Phytoplankton samples are analyzed by PhycoTech, Inc., a private lab specializing in phytoplankton analyses (see data protocol for procedures). Samples for Wingra and Fish lakes are archived but not routinely counted. Permanent slide mounts (3 per sample) are prepared for all analyzed Mendota and Monona samples as well as 6 samples per year for Wingra and Fish; the slide mounts are archived at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Zoology Museum. Phytoplankton are identified to species using an inverted microscope (Utermohl technique) and are reported as natural unit (i.e., colonies, filaments, or single cells) densities per mL, cell densities per mL, and algal biovolume densities per mL. Multiple entries for the same species on the same date may be due to different variants or vegetative states - (e.g., colonial or attached vs. free cell.) Biovolumes for individual cells of each species are determined during the counting procedure by obtaining cell measurements needed to calculate volumes for geometric solids (e.g., cylinders, spheres, truncated cones) corresponding to actual cell shapes. Biovolume concentrations are then computed by mulitplying the average cell biovolume by the cell densities in the water sample. Note that one million cubicMicrometers of biovolume PerMilliliter of water are equal to a biovolume concentration of one cubicMillimeterPerMilliliter. Assuming a cell density equal to water, a cubicMillimeterPerMilliliter of biovolume converts to a biomass concentration of one milligramPerLiter.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The one-dimensional hydrodynamic ice model, DYRESM-WQ-I, was modified to simulate ice cover and thermal structure of dimictic Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, over a continuous 104-year period (1911–2014). The model results were then used to examine the drivers of changes in ice cover and water temperature, focusing on the responses to shifts in air temperature, wind speed, and water clarity at multiyear timescales. Observations of the drivers include a change in the trend of warming air temperatures from 0.081 °C per decade before 1981 to 0.334 °C per decade thereafter, as well as a shift in mean wind speed from 4.44 m s$^{\textrm{−1}}$ before 1994 to 3.74 m s$^{\textrm{−1}}$ thereafter. Observations show that Lake Mendota has experienced significant changes in ice cover: later ice-on date(9.0 days later per century), earlier ice-off date (12.3 days per century), decreasing ice cover duration (21.3 days per century), while model simulations indicate a change in maximum ice thickness (12.7 cm decrease per century). Model simulations also show changes in the lake thermal regime of earlier stratification onset (12.3 days per century), later fall turnover (14.6 days per century), longer stratification duration (26.8 days per century), and decreasing summer hypolimnetic temperatures (−1.4 °C per century). Correlation analysis of lake variables and driving variables revealed ice cover variables, stratification onset, epilimnetic temperature, and hypolimnetic temperature were most closely correlated with air temperature, whereas freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic heating, and fall turnover date were more closely correlated with wind speed. Each lake variable (i.e., ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, maximum ice thickness, freeze-over water temperature, stratification onset, fall turnover date, stratification duration, epilimnion temperature, hypolimnion temperature, and hypolimnetic heating) was averaged for the three periods (1911–1980, 1981–1993, and 1994–2014) delineated by abrupt changes in air temperature and wind speed. Average summer hypolimnetic temperature and fall turnover date exhibit significant differences between the third period and the first two periods. Changes in ice cover (ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, and maximum ice thickness) exhibit an abrupt change after 1994, which was related in part to the warm El Niño winter of 1997–1998. Under-ice water temperature, freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic temperature, fall turnover date, and stratification duration demonstrate a significant difference in the third period (1994–2014), when air temperature was warmest and wind speeds decreased rather abruptly. The trends in ice cover and water temperature demonstrate responses to both long-term and abrupt changes in meteorological conditions that can be complemented with numerical modeling to better understand how these variables will respond in a future climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            Invasive species impart abrupt changes on ecosystems, but their impacts on microbial communities are often overlooked. We paired a 20-year freshwater microbial community time series with zooplankton and phytoplankton counts, rich environmental data, and a 6-year cyanotoxin time series. We observed strong microbial phenological patterns that were disrupted by the invasions of spiny water flea (
            Bythotrephes longimanus
            ) and zebra mussels (
            Dreissena polymorpha
            ). First, we detected shifts in
            Cyanobacteria
            phenology. After the spiny water flea invasion,
            Cyanobacteria
            dominance crept earlier into clearwater; and after the zebra mussel invasion,
            Cyanobacteria
            abundance crept even earlier into the diatom-dominated spring. During summer, the spiny water flea invasion sparked a cascade of shifting diversity where zooplankton diversity decreased and
            Cyanobacteria
            diversity increased. Second, we detected shifts in cyanotoxin phenology. After the zebra mussel invasion, microcystin increased in early summer and the duration of toxin production increased by over a month. Third, we observed shifts in heterotrophic bacteria phenology. After both invasions, heterotrophic bacteria with putative cyanobacterial associations increased. The
            Bacteroidota
            phylum and members of the acI
            Nanopelagicales
            lineage were differentially more abundant. The diverse summer bacterial community was most resistant to change from the zebra mussel invasion despite the observed shifts in diversity and toxicity during the summer; but the spring and clearwater bacterial communities changed most from the spiny water flea invasion, which lessened clearwater duration and intensity. These long-term invasion-mediated shifts in microbial phenology demonstrate the interconnectedness of microbes with the broader food web, and their susceptibility to long-term environmental change.
          
          
            Significance Statement
            
              Microbial communities are typically studied as part of the microbial loop, separately from the broader food web. Using a two-decade freshwater time series, we explored whether two species invasions that shifted the metazoan food web also impacted the microbial community. We looked for seasonal responses because of strong seasonal patterns within the microbial community. We discovered that
              Cyanobacteria
              increased in the clearwater and spring seasons, and that
              Cyanobacteria
              diversity increased in the summer. Cyanotoxins also increased in early summer, and the duration of toxin production increased. In the heterotrophic bacterial community, many organisms that putatively interact with
              Cyanobacteria
              increased. These findings represent direct observations of long-term bacterial change, and of the interconnectedness of bacteria with the broader food web.},

            Our planet is being subjected to unprecedented climate change, with far-reaching social and ecological repercussions. Below the waterline, aquatic ecosystems are being affected by multiple climate-related and anthropogenic stressors, the combined effects of which are poorly understood and rarely appreciated at the global stage. A striking consequence of climate change on aquatic ecosystems is that many are experiencing shorter periods of ice cover, as well as earlier and longer summer stratified seasons, which often result in a cascade of ecological and environmental consequences, such as warmer summer water temperatures, alterations in lake mixing and water levels, declines in dissolved oxygen, increased likelihood of cyanobacterial algal blooms, and the loss of habitat for native cold-water fisheries. The repercussions of a changing climate include impacts on freshwater supplies, water quality, biodiversity, and the ecosystem benefits that they provide to society.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems can undergo abrupt regime shifts as a result of many factors. Shifts between turbid and clearwater states are well understood for human-impacted shallow lakes, but are not well understood in other types of lakes. Here we use long-term data to describe abrupt shifts in water clarity in Trout Lake, an oligotrophic lake with a largely undeveloped watershed. For several decades mean summer water clarity averaged 4.5 m, but then around 2007 water clarity sharply increased and the “clear water regime” persisted for nearly a decade. Nutrient availability did not explain these changes, but rather they were explained by a classic top-down trophic cascade. Around 2007, the population of the apex pelagic predator, Lake Trout, substantially increased. This was accompanied by a sharp decline in the lake's major pelagic prey fish, the zooplanktivorous Cisco. In turn, there was an increase in large-bodied zooplankton taxa (calanoids, Daphnia), which reduced algal biomass. This clear water regime was then disrupted in 2014 by the invasion of a predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes cederstroemi. This invasion corresponded to strong impacts on lower trophic levels (decrease in large-bodied zooplankton and decreased water clarity), but more minor impacts on higher trophic levels (increased Cisco, decreased Lake Trout abundances)—in effect reversing the trophic cascade and shifting Trout Lake to a novel ecosystem state. Our study provides a long-term, empirically based example of successive ecological regime shifts that occurred from the rise of an apex predator and a mid-trophic level invasion in an undeveloped, oligotrophic lake.},

	abstract = {Although climate change has shifted the phenological timing of plankton in lakes, few studies have explicitly addressed the relative contributions of climate change and other factors, including planktivory and nutrient availability. The spring clear-water phase is a period of marked reduction in algal biomass and increased water transparency observed in many lakes. Here, we quantified the phenological patterns in the start date, maximum date, duration, and magnitude of the clear-water phase over 38 yr in Lakes Mendota and Monona, and examined the effects of water temperature, total phosphorus, and food web structure (proportion of large-bodied Daphnia pulicaria and density of invasive Bythotrephes) and interactions between temperature and other predictors on these clear-water phase metrics. We found that climate and food web structure affected the clear-water phase, but the effects differed among the metrics. Higher water temperature led to earlier clear-water phase start dates and maximum dates in both lakes. The proportion of D. pulicaria affected all clear-water phase metrics in both lakes. When D. pulicaria proportion was higher, the clear-water phase occurred earlier, lasted longer, and the water was clearer. Moreover, high Bythotrephes density delayed clear-water phase start dates (both lakes), and decreased clear-water phase duration (Lake Mendota) in the following year. These results suggest that variation in food web structure changes the full phenological dynamics of the clear-water phase, while variation in climate condition affects clear-water phase timing only. Our findings highlight the importance of large-bodied grazers for managing water quality under climate change.},

Population irruptions are commonly misinterpreted as a recent arrival of the nonnative species, but sleeper populations belie a more complex history of inconspicuous occurrence followed by an abrupt shift in abundance and ecological impact.

	abstract = {Despite growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services and the economic and ecological harm caused by invasive species, linkages between invasions, changes in ecosystem functioning, and in turn, provisioning of ecosystem services remain poorly documented and poorly understood. We evaluate the economic impacts of an invasion that cascaded through a food web to cause substantial declines in water clarity, a valued ecosystem service. The predatory zooplankton, the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1980s and has subsequently undergone secondary spread to inland lakes, including Lake Mendota (Wisconsin), in 2009. In Lake Mendota, Bythotrephes has reached unparalleled densities compared with in other lakes, decreasing biomass of the grazer Daphnia pulicaria and causing a decline in water clarity of nearly 1 m. Time series modeling revealed that the loss in water clarity, valued at US\$140 million (US\$640 per household), could be reversed by a 71\% reduction in phosphorus loading. A phosphorus reduction of this magnitude is estimated to cost between US\$86.5 million and US\$163 million (US\$430–US\$810 per household). Estimates of the economic effects of Great Lakes invasive species may increase considerably if cases of secondary invasions into inland lakes, such as Lake Mendota, are included. Furthermore, such extreme cases of economic damages call for increased investment in the prevention and control of invasive species to better maximize the economic benefits of such programs. Our results highlight the need to more fully incorporate ecosystem services into our analysis of invasive species impacts, management, and public policy.},

	abstract = {Understanding invasive species spread and projecting how distributions will respond to climate change is a central task for ecologists. Typically, current and projected air temperatures are used to forecast future distributions of invasive species based on climate matching in an ecological niche modeling approach. While this approach was originally developed for terrestrial species, it has also been widely applied to aquatic species even though aquatic species do not experience air temperatures directly. In the case of lakes, species respond to lake thermal regimes, which reflect the interaction of climate and lake attributes such as depth, size, and clarity. The result is that adjacent waterbodies can differ notably in thermal regime. Given these obvious limitations of modeling aquatic species distributions using climate data, we take advantage of recent advances in simulating lake thermal regimes to model the distributions of invasive spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederströmii) for current and projected future climates in the upper Midwest of the USA. We compared predictions and future projections from models based on modeled air temperatures with models based on modeled water temperature. All models predicted that the number of suitable lakes in the region will decrease with climate change. Models based on air and water temperature differed dramatically in the extent of this decrease. The air temperature model predicted 89\% of study lakes to be suitable, with suitability declining dramatically in the late century with climate warming to just a single suitable lake. Lake suitability predictions from the water temperature model declined to a much lesser degree with warming (42\% of lakes were predicted to be suitable, declining to 19\% in the late century) and were more spatially independent. Our results expose the limitations of using air temperatures to model habitat suitability for aquatic species, and our study further highlights the importance of understanding lake-specific responses to climate when assessing aquatic species responses to climate change. While we project a contraction in the potential range of Bythotrephes with warming in the study region, we anticipate that Bythotrephes will likely continue to expand into new lakes that will remain suitable in the following decades.},

	abstract = {Cultural eutrophication of lakes due to excess loading of nutrients is a global problem affecting the provisioning of freshwater ecosystem services. Lake water quality is often described by trophic state indicators such as water clarity or concentrations of nutrients, chlorophyll, and cyanobacteria toxins. While these indicators are widely assumed to covary, capturing the same basic aspects of water quality, they can be uncoupled by changes in lake food webs. Outbreak of the invasive predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes longimanus, in Lakes Mendota and Monona, Wisconsin (U.S.A.) in 2009 led to a decline in the herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, and in turn, water clarity. We use 20-yr datasets for Lakes Mendota and Monona to evaluate interactions among nutrients, zooplankton, and phytoplankton that resulted in this trophic cascade. After invasion, diatoms increased in both lakes resulting in reduced water clarity, whereas cyanobacteria did not change in either lake. Multivariate time series analysis revealed that D. pulicaria grazing controlled edible diatoms in both lakes. Cyanobacteria biomass was positively associated with both D. pulicaria and summer nutrient concentrations. These results further clarify the limitations of top-down control in eutrophic lakes: grazing by zooplankton can control edible phytoplankton taxa, but largely inedible cyanobacteria may be more limited by nutrient concentrations. Accordingly, despite declining clarity in Lake Mendota, the number of beach closures due to cyanobacteria blooms declined following Bythotrephes invasion. Our study reveals how these two indicators of water quality—water clarity and cyanobacteria blooms—can become uncoupled during a food web shift.},

	abstract = {When an invasive species appears at a new location, we typically have no knowledge of the population dynamics leading up to that moment. Is the establishment of invasive propagules closely followed by the appearance of the population? Or alternatively, was there an established low-density population that was released from a constraint and crossed the detection threshold? The early stages of the invasion process are a critical gap in our knowledge, yet vitally important for the detection and management of invasions. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence supporting the lag scenario for an invasive species outbreak. The invasive predatory zooplankton, spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), was detected in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (USA), in summer of 2009 and rapidly reached and sustained exceptionally high densities. To evaluate whether Bythotrephes' outbreak immediately followed introduction or erupted from an established low-density population, we constructed a population model of Bythotrephes in Lake Mendota. In the model, Bythotrephes persisted indefinitely at low levels until favorable thermal conditions in 2009, the coolest July since at least 1895, allowed it to erupt to high densities and establish a large egg bank in the lake sediments. The egg bank stabilized the population in the high-density state despite a return to nonfavorable thermal conditions, which is further supported by demographic data suggesting a constant contribution from the egg bank during the year. The prolonged lag scenario is corroborated by the detection of two individual Bythotrephes in pre-2009 archived samples, and the detection of Bythotrephes spines in lake sediment core layers dating back to 1994 (±5 yr). Together, our results suggest that Bythotrephes persisted for at least a decade below the detection limit, until optimal thermal conditions triggered a population outbreak. This work highlights the potential for environmental conditions to trigger invasive species outbreaks from low-density populations.},

	abstract = {Invasive species impart abrupt changes on ecosystems, but their impacts on microbial communities are often overlooked. We paired a 20-year freshwater microbial community time series with zooplankton and phytoplankton counts, rich environmental data, and a 6-year cyanotoxin time series. We observed strong microbial phenological patterns that were disrupted by the invasions of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). First, we detected shifts in Cyanobacteria phenology. After the spiny water flea invasion, Cyanobacteria dominance crept earlier into clearwater; and after the zebra mussel invasion, Cyanobacteria abundance crept even earlier into the diatom-dominated spring. During summer, the spiny water flea invasion sparked a cascade of shifting diversity where zooplankton diversity decreased and Cyanobacteria diversity increased. Second, we detected shifts in cyanotoxin phenology. After the zebra mussel invasion, microcystin increased in early summer and the duration of toxin production increased by over a month. Third, we observed shifts in heterotrophic bacteria phenology. After both invasions, heterotrophic bacteria with putative cyanobacterial associations increased. The Bacteroidota phylum and members of the acI Nanopelagicales lineage were differentially more abundant. The diverse summer bacterial community was most resistant to change from the zebra mussel invasion despite the observed shifts in diversity and toxicity during the summer; but the spring and clearwater bacterial communities changed most from the spiny water flea invasion, which lessened clearwater duration and intensity. These long-term invasion-mediated shifts in microbial phenology demonstrate the interconnectedness of microbes with the broader food web, and their susceptibility to long-term environmental change.},

We describe 3 yr of dose-response experiments that evaluate hatching success of the resting egg of Bythotrephes longimanus (Cladocera: Cercopagidae) in response to salinity, chlorination, heat, desiccation, and freezing. There was no decline in hatching success in response to salinity (up to 4 weeks at 35 g L−1 salt) or chlorination (including up to 5 min at 3400 mg L−1 chlorine). In response to heat there was an interaction between time and temperature; hatching occurred after exposure to 40°C for 1 min, 5 min, or 10 min but declined with the two longer exposures. Hatching also occurred after exposure to 50°C for 1 min, but no hatching followed exposure to 50°C for 5 min or to higher temperatures for 1 min. In response to desiccation at 17°C, exposure for ≤ 4 h had no effect on hatching but ≥ 6 h resulted in no hatching. When frozen, hatching success depended on whether eggs were frozen in water or without water. Collectively, the results are congruent with an evolutionary origin of B. longimanus in permanent, euryhaline basins. The results advance our understanding of dispersal limits of B. longimanus, including vector potential, and may inform management practices for reducing range expansion of B. longimanus by humans.},

	abstract = {Many coastal marine systems have extensive areas with anoxic sediments and it is not well known how these conditions affect the benthic–pelagic coupling. Zooplankton lay their eggs in the pelagic zone, and some sink and lie dormant in the sediment, before hatched zooplankton return to the water column. In this study, we investigated how oxygenation of long-term anoxic sediments affects the hatching frequency of dormant zooplankton eggs. Anoxic sediments from the brackish Baltic Sea were sampled and incubated for 26 days with constant aeration whereby, the sediment surface and the overlying water were turned oxic. Newly hatched rotifers and copepod nauplii (juveniles) were observed after 5 and 8 days, respectively. Approximately 1.5 × 105 nauplii m−2 emerged from sediment turned oxic compared with 0.02 × 105 m−2 from controls maintained anoxic. This study demonstrated that re-oxygenation of anoxic sediments activated a large pool of buried zooplankton eggs, strengthening the benthic–pelagic coupling of the system. Modelling of the studied anoxic zone suggested that a substantial part of the pelagic copepod population can derive from hatching of dormant eggs. We suggest that this process should be included in future studies to understand population dynamics and carbon flows in marine pelagic systems.},

	abstract = {Human impacts on freshwater ecosystems are pervasive, but the short and discontinuous nature of most datasets limits our ability to understand the controls on water quality and effectively manage freshwater resources. We examine change in Lake Mendota (Madison, Wisconsin) over the last two centuries by pairing analyses of a sedimentary archive with the site's {\textgreater} 100 yr limnological record. We show that eutrophication of the lake, evident as an abrupt shift in sediment composition, began in the late 19th century following the intensification of urban and agricultural land use in the watershed. Efforts to address deterioration of lake water quality, including the removal of point-source pollutants and biomanipulation, have had a measurable influence on sediment composition and water clarity. Since the early 1980s, quasi-seasonal cycles of phytoplankton blooms have induced calcite precipitation, leaving distinct laminations in the sedimentary record. These “whiting events” evidently did not accumulate in lake sediments until the late 20th century, indicating that efforts to remediate water quality have shifted the lake to a new ecosystem state. Calcite whitings can improve water quality in eutrophic lakes by coprecipitation with phosphate, increasing phosphorus (P) burial in lake sediments. Using long-term limnological records, we report negative correlations between calcite saturation indices and P in lake surface waters and show that calcite whitings could partially explain recent P decline in Lake Mendota surface waters. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized potential control on water quality in this eutrophic lake and demonstrates the benefit of coupling long-term limnological data with sedimentary records.},

	abstract = {Trophic cascades can determine the structure of aquatic food webs, a role often used to manage water quality in lakes. However, trophic cascades are subject to multiple interacting drivers of environmental change. For example, invasive species can dramatically alter food webs, though we know less about invasive species effects on managed trophic cascades. Here, we investigate the changing food web dynamics of Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, U.S.A.) over a 40-yr time period. Piscivore stocking (biomanipulation) beginning in 1988 coupled with a 1987 die-off of cisco (the dominant zooplanktivore) led to decreased zooplanktivory that cascaded to increases in the large-bodied herbivorous zooplankton Daphnia pulicaria and greater water clarity. In 2009, the invasive spiny water flea Bythotrephes longimanus was first detected in Lake Mendota and soon reached record densities. As a result of this invasive invertebrate predator, zooplanktivory increased to 47\% of the earlier cisco period. Concomitant with the spiny water flea population explosion were declines in D. pulicaria and water clarity as both exhibited a strong negative relationship to zooplanktivory across the 40-yr time series. We argue that the trophic cascade of 1987–1988 created an environment of high food resources and low fish planktivory that promoted the proliferation of Bythotrephes as it functionally replaced cisco in Lake Mendota's food web. Our results highlight how a manipulated, eutrophic lake was vulnerable to adverse impacts by invasive species, calling attention to the importance of understanding interactions among drivers of environmental change.},

Such efforts are constrained by our limited capacity to efficiently detect invasive species. Here, we present the case of Bythotrephes longimanus (spiny water flea) invasion into Wisconsin lakes. Detecting Bythotrephes has proven to be challenging due to its capacity to persist at low densities and its highly seasonal population dynamics. We use Bythotrephes to explore detection using three monitoring methods: zooplankton net tows, environmental DNA (eDNA), and sampling of Bythotrephes tail spine subfossils in sediments. Detection probabilities were highly seasonal for both the net tow and eDNA sampling methods—though detections occurred one to two weeks earlier in net tows—and seasonal targeting substantially improved detection by both methods. Conversely, Bythotrephes spine subfossils were found in all 10 lakes with confirmed Bythotrephes populations and in all five samples taken from each lake, except for a single lake where four of the five samples had subfossils. This method was insensitive to seasonally varying population densities as sediments integrate over variation in population densities. In this case, detection and abundance estimation were well covered by sediments and zooplankton nets, respectively, and eDNA provided little additional benefit to surveillance. Our work highlights the importance of choosing methods that address both species life history and monitoring objectives when designing surveillance programs.},

Due to its transparency and tolerance of higher temperature, Leptodora could avoid fish predation and, therefore, competes with Bythotrephes longimanus successfully. In addition, the differences between the two species may account for the spatial and temporal niche segregation in oligotrophic Swiss Lakes. But spatial niche segregation is less important in mesotrophic lakes with high prey density than in oligotrophic lakes with low prey density. In small, eutrophic lakes importance of temporal niche segregation also decreases, and Bythotrephes is seldom or not present. The preference of Bythotrephes to live in deeper water to avoid fish predation during summer may be the cause of its difficulties to establish itself in small and eutrophic lakes with high prey densities, where the hypolimnion is missing or anoxic.},

	abstract = {Recent changes in climate and eutrophication have caused increases in oxygen depletion in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. However, the impact of oxygen stress on zooplankton, which is the major trophic link between primary producers and fish, remains largely unknown in lakes. Therefore, we studied 41 lakes with different trophic and oxygen conditions to assess the role of oxygen stress on zooplankton communities and carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Samples were collected from each lake at the peak of summer stratification from three depth layers (the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion). Our results revealed that freshwater zooplankton were relatively tolerant to anoxic conditions and the greatest changes in community structure were found in lakes with the highest oxygen deficits. This caused a switch in dominance from large to small species and reduced the zooplankton biomass in lower, anoxic layers of water, but not in the upper layers of water where the oxygen deficits began. This upper anoxic layer could thus be a very important refuge for zooplankton to avoid predation during the day. However, the reduction of zooplankton in the lower water layers was the main factor that reduced the effectiveness of carbon transfer between the phytoplankton and zooplankton.},

Although proximal control over lake DO can be attributed to metabolism and physical processes, how those processes evolve over decades largely remains unexplored. Metabolism phenology may reveal the importance of coherence among lakes and facilitate general conclusions about the controls on lake metabolism at regional scales. We developed a Bayesian modeling framework to estimate DO concentrations and metabolism in eight lakes in contrasting landscapes in Wisconsin, USA. We identify the DO and metabolism phenologies for each lake, and use those to compare how decadal patterns relate to trophic state and landscape setting. We show that lakes can be categorized by their hypolimnetic oxygen consumption dynamics, with oligotrophic lakes having a diverse set of patterns and eutrophic lakes having uniform trends of increased oxygen consumption over the last decade. Metabolism phenology is likewise diverse for oligotrophic lakes, whereas eutrophic lakes in southern Wisconsin share consistent long-term patterns of metabolic trends and seasonal DO consumption highlighting the importance of trophic state driving metabolism. Eutrophic lakes had higher magnitudes and more seasonal variation in net ecosystem production in contrast to oligotrophic lakes. Generally, long-term metabolic trends of north temperate lakes suggest a limited influence of climate on lake metabolism and that temporal coherence of long-term metabolism change is driven primarily by the landscape setting.},

Our goal was to understand how concurrent environmental stressors such as climate change, eutrophication, and salinization affect long-term lake water quality. We report epilimnetic changes in 18 water-quality parameters collected at seven sites from 1980 to 2016 in Lake George, a large oligotrophic lake in the Adirondack Park, New York, USA. Improvements and deteriorations in water quality occurred over 37 years. We observed a 32\% increase in chlorophyll a associated with an increase in orthophosphate, but not total phosphorus or a warming epilimnion (0.05°C/year). Salinization from road deicing salts contributed to the largest deterioration in water quality. However, chloride concentrations and the current rate of increase are low enough that few ecological impacts are likely to occur over the next few decades. Increasing calcium concentrations were not high enough to facilitate the persistence of invasive species in the lake such as zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) but are sufficient for Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) and the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus). Similar to other lakes, environmental legislation has supported recovery from acidification, indicated by reduced sulfate and nitrate, and increased alkalinity and pH. Declines in water quality were minor relative to other lakes, suggesting that decades of tourism and development occurred without major deterioration in water quality, but management efforts are needed to curb salinization in the Lake George watershed, particularly as it relates to sodium concentrations to prevent a loss of drinking water quality.},

We used a combination of uni- and multivariate analyses to examine variation in Bythotrephes interannual and seasonal abundance, and life-history characteristics in Lake Simcoe from 1999 to 2007, and we explored the biotic (predators, prey) and/or abiotic (water quality, temperature) factors that may have regulated its population over this period. The mean annual abundance of Bythotrephes varied by an order of magnitude over the period of study and was significantly associated with epilimnetic temperature and prey and predator abundance. Bythotrephes typically appeared in early summer and had 2 seasonal abundance peaks, which varied in magnitude and timing within and among years. August and September Secchi depth and total phosphorus concentration predicted groups of years with similar Bythotrephes phenologies, lending further support to the role of water clarity as a significant component of this visual predator’s habitat in its invaded range. Bythotrephes body size and reproductive patterns also varied seasonally, possibly reflecting the seasonal availability of cladoceran prey, predation pressure from planktivorous fish, or adaptations to avoid unfavourable conditions. Overall, a complex interaction of fish predation, food availability, temperature, and water clarity controlled the dynamics of Bythotrephes in Lake Simcoe. Changes to the Lake Simcoe ecosystem due to Bythotrephes invasion may have important consequences for the ecosystem services provided by the lake and merit further investigation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The concentration of oxygen is fundamental to lake water quality and ecosystem functioning through its control over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrient loads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal timescales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic–ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stability indices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internal heat), identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the interannual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50–60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior to summer stratification were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largely driven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in 2010 was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although the cause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion by the predacious zooplankton \textit{Bythotrephes longimanus}. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) loading to lakes is degrading the quality and usability of water globally. Accurate predictions of lake P dynamics are needed to understand whole-ecosystem P budgets, as well as the consequences of changing lake P concentrations for water quality. However, complex biophysical processes within lakes, along with limited observational data, challenge our capacity to reproduce short-term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions, as well as long-term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake P. Here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling, process-guided machine learning (PGML), to produce a phosphorus budget for Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades. In our implementation of PGML, which we term a Process-Guided Recurrent Neural Network (PGRNN), we combine a process-based model for lake P with a recurrent neural network, and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles. We test independently the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN to evaluate the overall approach. The process-based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake P; however it missed the long-term trend in lake P and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer P in surface waters. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN was 33.0 μg P L−1, 22.7 μg P L−1, and 20.7 μg P L−1, respectively. All models performed better during summer, with RMSE values for the three models (same order) equal to 14.3 μg P L−1, 10.9 μg P L−1, and 10.7 μg P L−1. Although the PGRNN had only marginally better RMSE during summer, it had lower bias and reproduced long-term decreases in lake P missed by the other two models. For all seasons and all years, the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.8 μg P L−1 and 28.0 μg P L−1, respectively. The output of PGRNN indicated that new processes related to water temperature, thermal stratification, and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model. By using ecological knowledge, as well as the information content of complex data, PGML shows promise as a technique for accurate prediction in messy, real-world ecological dynamics, while providing valuable information that can improve our understanding of process.},

	abstract = {In the context-dependent world of biological invasions, biologists understand few general patterns of spread and impact. One possible exception is the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), an invader that routinely restructures food webs through an ecosystem engineering process termed “benthification.” By efficiently consuming phytoplankton, zebra mussels can increase light penetration and nutrient concentrations in the benthos of a lake, thereby stimulating growth of benthic periphyton (phytobenthos) and macroinvertebrates (zoobenthos). Few studies monitor the response of these benthic communities to invasion. We documented early changes in phytobenthos and zoobenthos as zebra mussels invaded eutrophic Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA). From 2015 to 2018, the number of zebra mussel individuals reached densities {\textgreater}30 000 m−2 on hard substrates and 3000 m−2 in macrophyte beds. Community data showed classic signs of benthification, including 300\% increases in (non-zebra mussel) zoobenthos and phytobenthos abundance on average across a depth gradient, including significant increases at depths where zebra mussels did colonize. Deep macrophyte biomass increased 900\%, but water clarity showed no significant rapid increase. We speculate that nutrient enrichment may be more strongly responsible than increased light penetration for the benthic response of Lake Mendota. Continued integration of benthic production and processes into our study of lake ecosystems will be critical to understanding whole ecosystem function, especially as zebra mussels continue to “benthify” lakes within their invaded range.},

	abstract = {Our changing climate is having effects on freshwater ecosystems in all seasons, especially winter. High latitude lakes, wetlands, and rivers are experiencing shorter periods of ice cover, and lower latitudes systems that used to freeze are experiencing open water conditions throughout the winter. A 2019 AGU Chapman conference convened aquatic scientists to examine these changes and address the implications of changing winters to aquatic life, chemistry, and physics. Several studies demonstrate decreased ice cover duration than in the past. The removal of an ice “lid” from lakes and rivers impacts the exchange of gases with the atmosphere and the predominant types of metabolism occurring in the waters below, with the potential for more photosynthesis and an increase in oxic versus anoxic metabolism when the lid is removed. Multiple studies indicated an increase in the interannual variability of winters, especially in terms of ice-cover duration and ice quality. Increased variability may simply be an outcome of a more variable winter climate or small differences in environmental conditions such as temperature that can have strong effects on gas exchange, light transmission, and turbulence when ice forms. A question that merits further consideration is whether and how winters of shorter duration and severity will change the dynamics of freshwater systems. Are there memory or legacy effects that carry over to the next season or year? There is much work to be done to understand how changing winters will impact the biogeochemical behavior of lakes and rivers in the coming decades.},

More extreme events in recent decades, including late ice-on, early ice-off, shorter periods of ice cover, or no ice cover at all, contribute to the increasing rate of lake ice loss.

This study uses 3510 time series from across 678 Northern Hemisphere lakes and rivers to explore historical patterns in lake and river ice phenology across five overlapping time periods (1931–1960, 1946–1975, 1961–1990, 1976–2005, and 1931–2005). These time series show that the number of annual open-water days increased by 0.63 d per decade from 1931–2005 across the Northern Hemisphere, with trends for breakup and, to a lesser extent, freeze-up closely correlating with regionally averaged temperature. Breakup and freeze-up trends display a spatiotemporally complex evolution and reveal considerable caveats with interpreting the implications of ice phenology changes at lake and river sites that may only have breakup or freeze-up data, rather than both. These results provide an important contribution by showing regional variation in ice phenology trends through time that can be hidden by longer-term trends. The overlapping 30-year time periods also show evidence for an acceleration in warming trends through time. Understanding the changes on both long- and short-term timescales will be important for determining the causes of this change, the underlying biogeochemical processes associated with it, and the wider climatological significance as global temperatures rise.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Extreme wind events affect lake phytoplankton amongst others by deepening the mixed layer and increasing internal nutrient loading. Both increases and decreases of phytoplankton biomass after storms have been observed, but the precise mechanisms driving these responses remain poorly understood or quantified. In this study, we coupled a one-dimensional physical model to a biogeochemical model to investigate the factors regulating short-term phytoplankton responses to summer storms, now and under expected warmer future conditions. We simulated physical, chemical and biological dynamics in Lake Erken, Sweden, and found that wind storms could increase or decrease the phytoplankton concentration one week after the storm, depending on antecedent lake physical and chemical conditions. Storms had little effect on phytoplankton biomass if the mixed layer was deep prior to storm exposure. Higher incoming shortwave radiation and hypolimnetic nutrient concentration boosted growth, whereas higher surface water temperatures decreased phytoplankton concentration after storms. Medium-intensity wind speeds resulted in more phytoplankton biomass after storms than high-intensity wind. Simulations under a future climate scenario did not show marked differences in the way wind affects phytoplankton growth following storms. Our study shows that storm impacts on lake phytoplankton are complex and likely to vary as a function of local environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {In most north temperate lakes, phytoplankton biomass oscillates on an annual scale. While phytoplankton seasonal succession within a year has been described for many lakes, much less is known about variability in seasonal succession over multiple years. Here, we describe how continuous wavelet transforms can be used to identify variation in the periodicity in phytoplankton time series at multiple timescales. To demonstrate our approach, we analyzed 16 years of biweekly phytoplankton data from eutrophic Lake Mendota, USA, that coincided with substantial variability in climate and nutrient loading. Throughout the time series, the wavelet transforms identified the annual scale as the dominant scale of variation in aggregated phytoplankton, except for a 3-year period when there was no significant dominant scale. This period coincided with drought and decreased nutrient loading. During this time, phytoplankton biomass was markedly lower, and the phytoplankton community exhibited a unimodal, not bimodal, pattern of seasonal succession. Our results highlight the utility of wavelet techniques for identifying changes in seasonal succession in long-term phytoplankton records, which are becoming more available for many lakes. As aquatic ecosystems increasingly experience exogenous forcings at multiple timescales, wavelet analyses provide a powerful tool for determining how phytoplankton communities may respond.},

	abstract = {Lake ecosystems, and the organisms that live within them, are vulnerable to temperature change1–5, including the increased occurrence of thermal extremes6. However, very little is known about lake heatwaves—periods of extreme warm lake surface water temperature—and how they may change under global warming. Here we use satellite observations and a numerical model to investigate changes in lake heatwaves for hundreds of lakes worldwide from 1901 to 2099. We show that lake heatwaves will become hotter and longer by the end of the twenty-first century. For the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), the average intensity of lake heatwaves, defined relative to the historical period (1970 to 1999), will increase from 3.7 ± 0.1 to 5.4 ± 0.8 degrees Celsius and their average duration will increase dramatically from 7.7 ± 0.4 to 95.5 ± 35.3 days. In the low-greenhouse-gas-emission RCP 2.6 scenario, heatwave intensity and duration will increase to 4.0 ± 0.2 degrees Celsius and 27.0 ± 7.6 days, respectively. Surface heatwaves are longer-lasting but less intense in deeper lakes (up to 60 metres deep) than in shallower lakes during both historic and future periods. As lakes warm during the twenty-first century7,8, their heatwaves will begin to extend across multiple seasons, with some lakes reaching a permanent heatwave state. Lake heatwaves are likely to exacerbate the adverse effects of long-term warming in lakes and exert widespread influence on their physical structure and chemical properties. Lake heatwaves could alter species composition by pushing aquatic species and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience. This in turn could threaten lake biodiversity9 and the key ecological and economic benefits that lakes provide to society.},

	abstract = {Inland lakes are socially and ecologically important components of many regional landscapes. Exploring lake responses to plausible future climate scenarios can provide important information needed to inform stakeholders of likely effects of hydrologic changes on these waterbodies in coming decades. To assess potential climate effects on lake hydrology, we combined a previously published spatially explicit, processed-based hydrologic modeling framework implemented over the lake-rich landscape of the Northern Highlands Lake District within the United States with an ensemble of climate change scenarios for the 2050s (2041–2070) and 2080s (2071–2100). Model results quantify the effects of climate change on water budgets and lake stage elevations for 3692 lakes and highlight the importance of landscape and hydrologic setting for the response of specific lake types to climate change. All future climate projections resulted in loss of ice cover and snowpack as well as increased evaporation, but variability in climate projections (warmer conditions, wet winters combined with wet or dry summers) interacted with lake characteristics and landscape position to produce variable lake hydrologic changes. Water levels for drainage lakes (lakes with substantial surface water inflows and outflows) showed nearly no change, whereas minimum water levels for seepage lakes (minimal surface water fluxes) decreased by an average of up to 2.64 m by the end of the 21st century. Our physically based modeling approach is parsimonious and computationally efficient and can be applied to other lake-rich regions to investigate interregional variability in lake hydrologic response to future climate scenarios.},

Here, using a high-resolution numerical model, we find that the velocity of climate change in the surface of inland standing waters globally was 3.5 ± 2.3 km per decade from 1861 to 2005, which is similar to, or lower than, rates of active dispersal of some motile species. However, from 2006 to 2099, the velocity of climate change will increase to 8.7 ± 5.5 km per decade under a low-emission pathway such as Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 or 57.0 ± 17.0 km per decade under a high-emission pathway such as RCP 8.5, meaning that the thermal habitat in inland standing waters will move faster than the ability of some species to disperse to cooler areas. The fragmented distribution of standing waters in a landscape will restrict redistribution, even for species with high dispersal ability, so that the negative consequences of rapid warming for freshwater species are likely to be much greater than in terrestrial and marine realms.},

Whereas the classical cooling-induced and shear-induced convections are well-known phenomena due to their dominant roles in ocean basins, other convective processes are specific to lakes and often overlooked, for example, sidearm, under-ice, and double-diffusive convection or thermobaric instability and bioconvection. Additionally, the peculiar properties of the density function at low salinities/temperatures leave distinctive traces.

These sediments are represented by a set of vertical columns with heat, moisture and CH4 transport inside. The model is validated vs. a comprehensive observational data set gathered at Kuivajärvi Lake (southern Finland), demonstrating a fair agreement. The value of a key calibration constant, regulating the magnitude of methane production in sediments, corresponded well to that obtained from another two lakes. We demonstrated via surface seiche parameterization that the near-bottom turbulence induced by surface seiches is likely to significantly affect CH4 accumulation there.

hydrodynamic-ecological lake model
DYRESM-CAEDYM, using a Monte Carlo sampling (MCS) method, in order to test
the applicability of this procedure for shallow, polymictic Lake Rotorua (New
Zealand). The calibration procedure involved independently minimizing the
root-mean-square error (RMSE), maximizing the Pearson correlation coefficient
(r) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficient coefficient (Nr) for comparisons
of model state variables against measured data. An assigned number of
parameter permutations was used for 10 000 simulation iterations. The
“optimal” temperature calibration produced a RMSE of 0.54 ∘C,
Nr value of 0.99, and r value of 0.98 through the whole water
column based on comparisons with 540 observed water temperatures collected
between 13 July 2007 and 13 January 2009. The modeled bottom dissolved oxygen
concentration (20.5 m below surface) was compared with 467 available
observations. The calculated RMSE of the simulations compared with the
measurements was 1.78 mg L−1, the Nr value was 0.75, and the
r value was 0.87. The autocalibrated model was further tested for an
independent data set by simulating bottom-water hypoxia events from 15
January 2009 to 8 June 2011 (875 days). This verification produced an
accurate simulation of five hypoxic events corresponding to
DO {\textless} 2 mg L−1 during summer of 2009–2011. The RMSE was
2.07 mg L−1, Nr value 0.62, and r value of 0.81, based on
the available data set of 738 days. The autocalibration software of
DYRESM-CAEDYM developed here is substantially less time-consuming and more
efficient in parameter optimization than traditional manual calibration which
has been the standard tool practiced for similar complex water quality
models.},

              The interaction between large inland water bodies and the atmosphere impacts the evolution of regional weather and climate, which in turn affects the lake dynamics, thermodynamics, ice-formation, and, therefore, ecosystems. Over the last decades, various approaches have been used to model lake thermodynamics and dynamics in standalone mode or coupled to numerical atmospheric models.

              multi-column lake model in standalone mode as a computationally-efficient alternative to a full three-dimensional hydrodynamic model in the case of Lake Geneva. While it struggles to reproduce some short-term features, the multi-column model reasonably reproduces the seasonal mean of the thermal horizontal and vertical structures governing heat and mass exchanges between the lake surface and the lower atmosphere (stratified period, thermocline depth, stability of the water column). As it requires typically two orders of magnitude less computational ressources, it may allow a two-way coupling with a RCM on timescales or spatial resolutions where full 3D lake models are too demanding.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The gas transfer velocity (k) is a major source of uncertainty when assessing the magnitude of lake gas exchange with the atmosphere. For the
diversity of existing empirical and process-based k models, the transfer velocity increases with the level of turbulence near the air–water
interface. However, predictions for k can vary by a factor of 2 among different models. Near-surface turbulence results from the action of wind
shear, surface waves, and buoyancy-driven convection. Wind shear has long been identified as a key driver, but recent lake studies have shifted the
focus towards the role of convection, particularly in small lakes. In large lakes, wind fetch can, however, be long enough to generate surface waves
and contribute to enhance gas transfer, as widely recognised in oceanographic studies. Here, field values for gas transfer velocity were computed in
a large hard-water lake, Lake Geneva, from CO2 fluxes measured with an automated (forced diffusion) flux chamber and CO2 partial
pressure measured with high-frequency sensors. k estimates were compared to a set of reference limnological and oceanic k models. Our analysis
reveals that accounting for surface waves generated during windy events significantly improves the accuracy of k estimates in this large lake. The
improved k model is then used to compute k over a 1-year time period. Results show that episodic extreme events with surface waves (6 \%
occurrence, significant wave height {\textgreater} 0.4 m) can generate more than 20 \% of annual cumulative k and more than 25 \% of annual
net CO2 fluxes in Lake Geneva. We conclude that for lakes whose fetch can exceed 15 km, k models need to integrate the effect of
surface waves.},

However, this perception is largely gained by downscaling knowledge from large lakes to their smaller counterparts. Here we show that shallow vegetated lakes (less than 0.6 m), in fact, undergo recurring daytime stratification and nocturnal mixing accompanied by extreme chemical variations during summer. Dense submerged vegetation effectively attenuates light and turbulence generating separation between warm surface waters and much colder bottom waters. Photosynthesis in surface waters produces oxygen accumulation and CO

              which is re-dissolved in bottom waters. Nocturnal convective mixing re-introduces oxygen into bottom waters for aerobic respiration and regenerated inorganic carbon into surface waters, which supports intense photosynthesis.

	abstract = {In this paper, the effects of littoral submerged macrophytes on weak stratification conditions in a small and shallow lake are investigated. Diverse submerged macrophytes occupying a large portion of the littoral zone act as resistance to water motions and affect lake hydrodynamics. Strong solar radiation and mild wind forcing typically occurring during the summer season result in weak stratification characterized by a diurnal cycle with a temperature differential of 1–3 °C. Temperature and circulation dynamics of a small and shallow lake are depicted by extensive field measurements and a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model with a generic length scale (GLS) approach for the turbulence closure and drag forces induced by macrophytes. Results show that the effects of macrophytes on velocity profiles are apparent. In the pelagic area, the circulation patterns with and without macrophytes are similar. The velocity profile is generally characterized by a two-layer structure with the maximum velocity at both the water surface and the mid-depth. In contrast, inside the littoral zone, the mean flow is retarded by macrophytes and the velocity profile is changed to only one maximum velocity at the surface with a steeper decrease until 2.0 m depth and another slight decrease to the lake bottom. From the whole lake perspective, littoral macrophytes dampen the horizontal water temperature difference between the upwind side and download side of the lake. Macrophytes promote a stronger temperature stratification by retarding mean flows and reducing vertical mixing. Overall, this study shows that the temperature structures and circulation patterns under weak stratification conditions in a small and shallow lake are strongly affected by littoral vegetation.},

Although the primary drivers of production and respiration such as the availability of nutrients, light, and carbon are well known, heterogeneity in hydrologic setting (for example, hydrological connectivity, morphometry, and residence) across and within regions may lead to highly variable responses to the same drivers of change, complicating our efforts to predict these responses. We explored how differences in hydrologic setting among lakes influenced spatial and inter annual variability in ecosystem metabolism, using high-frequency oxygen sensor data from 11 lakes over 8 years. Trends in mean metabolic rates of lakes generally followed gradients of nutrient and carbon concentrations, which were lowest in seepage lakes, followed by drainage lakes, and higher in bog lakes. We found that while ecosystem respiration (ER) was consistently higher in wet years in all hydrologic settings, gross primary production (GPP) only increased in tandem in drainage lakes. However, interannual rates of ER and GPP were relatively stable in drainage lakes, in contrast to seepage and bog lakes which had coefficients of variation in metabolism between 22–32\%. We explored how the geospatial context of lakes, including hydrologic residence time, watershed area to lake area, and landscape position influenced the sensitivity of individual lake responses to climatic variation. We propose a conceptual framework to help steer future investigations of how hydrologic setting mediates the response of metabolism to climatic variability.},

              concentration and primary production carried out in the Ría de Vigo (NW Iberian upwelling system) between March 2017 and May 2018 to investigate the relationship between turbulent mixing and phytoplankton growth at different temporal scales. In order to interpret our results, we used the theoretical framework described by the Critical Turbulent Hypothesis (CTH). According to this conceptual model if turbulence is low enough, the depth of the layer where mixing is active can be shallower than the mixed-layer depth, and phytoplankton may receive enough light to bloom. Our results showed that the coupling between turbulent mixing and phytoplankton growth in this system occurs at seasonal, but also at shorter time scales. In agreement with the CTH, higher phytoplankton growth rates were observed when mixing was low during spring-summer transitional and upwelling periods, whereas low values were described during periods of high mixing (fall-winter transitional and downwelling). However, low mixing conditions were not enough to ensure phytoplankton growth, as low phytoplankton growth was also found under these circumstances. Wavelet spectral analysis revealed that turbulent mixing and phytoplankton growth were also related at shorter time scales. The higher coherence between both variables was found in spring-summer at the {\textasciitilde}16–30 d period and in fall-winter at the {\textasciitilde}16–90 d period. These results suggest that mixing could act as a control factor on phytoplankton growth over the seasonal cycle, and could be also involved in the formation of occasional short-lived phytoplankton blooms.},

	abstract = {Eutrophication increases hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs, causing deleterious effects on biological communities. Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

To understand what drove observed evolutionary patterns, we interpreted them in the context of its population dynamics, growth rate, and light adaptation, and the size and macromolecular and elemental composition of cells. This multilevel view suggests that, over the course of evolution, there was a steady increase in
              Prochlorococcus
              ’ metabolic rate and excretion of organic carbon. We derived a mathematical framework that suggests these adaptations lower the minimal subsistence nutrient concentration of cells, which results in a drawdown of nutrients in oceanic surface waters. This, in turn, increases total ecosystem biomass and promotes the coevolution of all cells in the ecosystem. Additional reconstructions suggest that
              Prochlorococcus
              and the dominant cooccurring heterotrophic bacterium SAR11 form a coevolved mutualism that maximizes their collective metabolic rate by recycling organic carbon through complementary excretion and uptake pathways. Moreover, the metabolic codependencies of
              Prochlorococcus
              and SAR11 are highly similar to those of chloroplasts and mitochondria within plant cells. These observations lead us to propose a general theory relating metabolic evolution to the self-amplification and self-organization of the biosphere. We discuss the implications of this framework for the evolution of Earth’s biogeochemical cycles and the rise of atmospheric oxygen.},

This article presents a framework that aligns observations and models along the dimension of abstraction or biological organization—from raw sequences to ecosystem patterns for observations, and from sequence simulators to ecological theory for models. It then reviews 16 studies that compared model results with molecular observations. Molecular data can and are being combined with microbial ecosystem models, but to keep up with and take advantage of the full scope of observations, models need to become more mechanistically detailed and complex, which is a technical and cultural challenge for the ecological modeling community.},

            Individual-based models, ‘IBMs’, describe naturally the dynamics of interacting organisms or social or financial agents. They are considered too complex for mathematical analysis, but computer simulations of them cannot give the general insights required. Here, we resolve this problem with a general mathematical framework for IBMs containing interactions of an unlimited level of complexity, and derive equations that reliably approximate the effects of space and stochasticity. We provide software, specified in an accessible and intuitive graphical way, so any researcher can obtain analytical and simulation results for any particular IBM without algebraic manipulation. We illustrate the framework with examples from movement ecology, conservation biology, and evolutionary ecology. This framework will provide unprecedented insights into a hitherto intractable panoply of complex models across many scientific fields.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Lake Tanganyika (LT) is the largest tropical freshwater lake, and the largest body of anoxic freshwater on Earth’s surface. LT’s mixed oxygenated surface waters float atop a permanently anoxic layer and host rich animal biodiversity. However, little is known about microorganisms inhabiting LT’s 1470 meter deep water column and their contributions to nutrient cycling, which affect ecosystem-level function and productivity. Here, we applied genome-resolved metagenomics and environmental analyses to link specific taxa to key biogeochemical processes across a vertical depth gradient in LT. We reconstructed 523 unique metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 34 bacterial and archaeal phyla, including many rarely observed in freshwater lakes. We identified sharp contrasts in community composition and metabolic potential with an abundance of typical freshwater taxa in oxygenated mixed upper layers, and Archaea and uncultured Candidate Phyla in deep anoxic waters. Genomic capacity for nitrogen and sulfur cycling was abundant in MAGs recovered from anoxic waters, highlighting microbial contributions to the productive surface layers via recycling of upwelled nutrients, and greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide. Overall, our study provides a blueprint for incorporation of aquatic microbial genomics in the representation of tropical freshwater lakes, especially in the context of ongoing climate change, which is predicted to bring increased stratification and anoxia to freshwater lakes.},

            Lake Lanier is an important freshwater lake for the southeast United States, as it represents the main source of drinking water for the Atlanta metropolitan area and is popular for recreational activities. Temperate freshwater lakes such as Lake Lanier are underrepresented among the growing number of environmental metagenomic data sets, and little is known about how functional gene content in freshwater communities relates to that of other ecosystems. To better characterize the gene content and variability of this freshwater planktonic microbial community, we sequenced several samples obtained around a strong summer storm event and during the fall water mixing using a random whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approach. Comparative metagenomics revealed that the gene content was relatively stable over time and more related to that of another freshwater lake and the surface ocean than to soil. However, the phylogenetic diversity of Lake Lanier communities was distinct from that of soil and marine communities. We identified several important genomic adaptations that account for these findings, such as the use of potassium (as opposed to sodium) osmoregulators by freshwater organisms and differences in the community average genome size. We show that the lake community is predominantly composed of sequence-discrete populations and describe a simple method to assess community complexity based on population richness and evenness and to determine the sequencing effort required to cover diversity in a sample. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity and metabolic potential of a temperate planktonic freshwater community and advances approaches for comparative metagenomics.},

	abstract = {We outline a perspective of an entirely new research branch in Earth and climate sciences, where deep neural networks and Earth system models are dismantled as individual methodological approaches and reassembled as learning, self-validating, and interpretable Earth system model-network hybrids. Following this path, we coin the term "Neural Earth System Modelling" (NESYM) and highlight the necessity of a transdisciplinary discussion platform, bringing together Earth and climate scientists, big data analysts, and AI experts. We examine the concurrent potential and pitfalls of Neural Earth System Modelling and discuss the open question whether artificial intelligence will not only infuse Earth system modelling, but ultimately render them obsolete.},

            Nearly 30 years ago, emerged the concept of deterministic chaos. With it came sensitivity to initial conditions, nonlinearities, and strange attractors. This constituted a paradigm shift that profoundly altered how numerical modellers approached dynamic systems. It also provided an opportunity to resolve a situation of mutual misunderstanding between scientists and non-scientists about uncertainties and predictability in natural systems. Our proposition is that this issue can be addressed in an original way which involves modelling based on the principles of chance and necessity (CaN). We outline the conceptual and mathematical principles of CaN models and present an application of the model to the Barents Sea food-web. Because CaN models rely on concepts easily grasped by all actors, because they are explicit about knowns and unknowns and because the interpretation of their results is simple without being prescriptive, they can be used in a context of participatory management. We propose that, three decades after the emergence of chaos theories, CaN can be a practical step to reconcile scientists and non-scientists around the modelling of structurally and dynamically complex natural systems, and significantly contribute to ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The epilimnion is the surface layer of a lake typically characterised as well mixed and is decoupled from the metalimnion due to a steep change in density. The concept of the epilimnion (and, more widely, the three-layered structure of a stratified lake) is fundamental in limnology, and calculating the depth of the epilimnion is essential to understanding many physical and ecological lake processes. Despite the ubiquity of the term, however, there is no objective or generic approach for defining the epilimnion, and a diverse number of approaches prevail in the literature. Given the increasing availability of water temperature and density profile data from lakes with a high spatio-temporal resolution, automated calculations, using such data, are particularly common, and they have vast potential for use with evolving long-term globally measured and modelled datasets. However, multi-site and multi-year studies, including those related to future climate impacts, require robust and automated algorithms for epilimnion depth estimation. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive comparison of commonly used epilimnion depth estimation methods, using a combined 17-year dataset, with over 4700 daily temperature profiles from two European lakes. Overall, we found a very large degree of variability in the estimated epilimnion depth across all methods and thresholds investigated and for both lakes. These differences, manifesting over high-frequency data, led to fundamentally different understandings of the epilimnion depth. In addition, estimations of the epilimnion depth were highly sensitive to small changes in the threshold value, complex thermal water column structures, and vertical data resolution. These results call into question the custom of arbitrary method selection and the potential problems this may cause for studies interested in estimating the ecological processes occurring within the epilimnion, multi-lake comparisons, or long-term time series analysis. We also identified important systematic differences between methods, which demonstrated how and why methods diverged. These results may provide rationale for future studies to select an appropriate epilimnion definition in light of their particular purpose and with awareness of the limitations of individual methods. While there is no prescribed rationale for selecting a particular method, the method which defined the epilimnion depth as the shallowest depth, where the density was 0.1 kg m−3 more than the surface density, may be particularly useful as a generic method.},

	abstract = {Abstract. One-dimensional hydrodynamic models are nowadays widely recognized as key
tools for lake studies. They offer the possibility to analyze processes at
high frequency, here referring to hourly timescales, to investigate
scenarios and test hypotheses. Yet, simulation outputs are mainly used by
the modellers themselves and often not easily reachable for the outside
community. We have developed an open-access web-based platform for
visualization and promotion of easy access to lake model output data updated
in near-real time (http://simstrat.eawag.ch, last access: 29 August 2019). This platform was developed for 54
lakes in Switzerland with potential for adaptation to other regions or at
global scale using appropriate forcing input data. The benefit of this data
platform is practically illustrated with two examples. First, we show that
the output data allows for assessing the long-term effects of past climate
change on the thermal structure of a lake. The study confirms the need to
not only evaluate changes in all atmospheric forcing but also changes in the
watershed or throughflow heat energy and changes in light penetration to
assess the lake thermal structure. Then, we show how the data platform can
be used to study and compare the role of episodic strong wind events for
different lakes on a regional scale and especially how their thermal
structure is temporarily destabilized. With this open-access data platform,
we demonstrate a new path forward for scientists and practitioners promoting
a cross exchange of expertise through openly sharing in situ and model
data.},

This paper shows a simple method to estimate the environmental pressure from the deicing of roads as steady state chloride concentration in water. The data processed are presented using GIS. The result showed that the contribution of deicing salt is of importance for the chloride concentration on a regional scale. The increase in chloride concentration is also compared to the background concentration and other sources of chloride within the river basin. Road salt applied by the Swedish National Road Administration (SNRA) accounts for more than half of the total chloride load for the river basin investigated.

	abstract = {Ides Cove is a small, relatively deep, isolated body of water adjoining Irondequoit Bay of Lake Ontario, Irondequoit, N.Y. In 1970–1971, the cove was meromictic with meromixis being attributed to the heavy application of delcing salts in the cove's watershed. Application of deicing salts to roads in the Town of Irondequoit has steadily declined from {\textgreater} 31,000 metric tons in 1970–1971 to {\textless} 4,000 tons in 1979–1980. The resultant decrease in salt concentrations of the surface waters of the cove since 1970 is evidence of recovery from meromixis. Also, complete mixing of the water column observed during the winter of 1979–1980 suggests that the town's “sensible salt use policy” has been a success. However, Cl− concentrations and conductivity in the hypolimnion during the spring, summer, and autumn have remained high due primarily to the discharge of naturally occurring salt from groundwater streams (mean annual Cl− = 303 mg/1) into the cove. The addition of naturally occurring salt into the cove currently affects mixing patterns by suppressing the autumn and spring turnover and probably affected mixing patterns in a similar manner prior to the advent of deicing operations.},

Chloride contamination of groundwater in the GTA was strongly related to urbanisation, and at the four most affected springs increases of between 21 and 34\% were detected over the period November 1996 to November 1997. The response of macroinvertebrates living in these springs to increasing salinity was examined with the aim of creating a biological index of contamination: the Chloride Contamination Index (CCI). A power function yielded a significant correlation between this index and the mean Cl concentration measured at each spring. Taxa were able to be categorised as either 'tolerant' or 'non-tolerant' of high Cl although none was unique to either end of the scale. However, from both field observations and salinity tolerance trials in the laboratory, the amphipod Gammarus pseudolimnaeus was found to be associated with source aquifers only mildly contaminated with Cl. Absence of this species from a spring, particularly if nymphs of the stonefly Nemoura trispinosa are present should indicate moderate to high contamination.},

	abstract = {Primarily as a result of road salting, the water masses ofLake Svinsjøen, a small meromictic lake in southeasternNorway, have been subject to great changes in salinity duringthe period 1947–1995. The greatest change in saltconcentration has occurred in the upper part of themonimolimnion (depth 10–15 m) where mean conductivityincreased 104.2 per cent, from 143 to 292 μS cm−1. Inthe upper mixolimnion (depth 0-5 m), mean conductivity rosefrom 130 to 238 μS cm−1 during the same period. Theions responsible for the salinity changes were Na+ andCl− from de-icing salts, and Ca2+ and Cl− fromsalts used to keep down dust from roads. Further sources ofCa2+ are the road asphalt and increased weathering andleaching of the lime-rich rocks caused by acid precipitation,the main source of the additional inputs of SO\$\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{4\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{2 - \}\}\} \$\$tothe lake. The salinity changes caused major changes inmeromictic stability, S\$\$S{\textbackslash}prime \_c \$\$. In the period1947-1966, S\$\$S{\textbackslash}prime \_c \$\$increased by 24 g cm cm−2,and the maximum level of meromictic stability, 125 gcm−2, was found in 1966. As a result of higher rate ofsalt accumulation in the upper part of the monimolimnion andin the mixolimnion, S\$\$S{\textbackslash}prime \_c \$\$decreased by 30 g cmcm−2 during the period 1966-1991, and a simultaneousrise in the chemocline took place. In the period 1991-1995 anadditional decrease of 26 g cm cm−2 occurred. Continuedectogenic inputs of salts through processes typical of thetime period investigated will in future further weaken thelake's meromictic stability, and may cause the demise ofmeromixis in Lake Svinsjøen, a development which may haveimportant implications for primary productivity of thelake.},

In this study, the seasonal influence of road salt influx on the geochemical cycling of a small, urban kettle lake is examined. Water column samples were collected approximately twice per month for fifteen months and analyzed for temperature, pH, conductivity, major ions, nutrients and redox-sensitive solutes. The lake water column was redox-stratified with high concentrations of dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), ammonium, phosphate and, during some periods, sulfide and methane in the hypolimnion. Bottom water anoxia was persistent throughout the entire sampling period. Concentrations of sodium and chloride, which correlated strongly with conductivity, were over a hundred times greater compared with levels in nearby rural lakes. Conductivity, chloride and calculated density profiles indicated the presence of a pycnocline at {\textasciitilde}9m depth that persisted throughout the sampling period.

The combined response of urban lakes to climatic changes and to urbanization of the catchment may be further altered by water quality management measures. We studied Lake Tegel in Berlin, Germany as a representative urban lake profoundly influenced by intense water management measures and a resulting complex hydrodynamic situation: Lake Tegel is fed by nutrient-rich river discharges and effluents from a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP). We estimated changes in water temperatures, the Wedderburn number, and the buoyancy frequency, as well as concentrations of dissolved oxygen and phosphate under climate change using a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model coupled to a water quality model. Further, we investigated how four management scenarios with varying discharges of the PEP could affect the lake system. In all simulations, water temperatures increased and summer stratification extended. The modeling results demonstrated that the water management system buffers the high nutrient supply from the river inflow and can effectively mitigate negative effects of climate change on Lake Tegel, thus highlighting its importance for the lake ecosystem.},

	abstract = {A large number and wide variety of lake ecosystem models have been developed and published during the past four decades. We identify two challenges for making further progress in this field. One such challenge is to avoid developing more models largely following the concept of others (‘reinventing the wheel’). The other challenge is to avoid focusing on only one type of model, while ignoring new and diverse approaches that have become available (‘having tunnel vision’). In this paper, we aim at improving the awareness of existing models and knowledge of concurrent approaches in lake ecosystem modelling, without covering all possible model tools and avenues. First, we present a broad variety of modelling approaches. To illustrate these approaches, we give brief descriptions of rather arbitrarily selected sets of specific models. We deal with static models (steady state and regression models), complex dynamic models (CAEDYM, CE-QUAL-W2, Delft 3D-ECO, LakeMab, LakeWeb, MyLake, PCLake, PROTECH, SALMO), structurally dynamic models and minimal dynamic models. We also discuss a group of approaches that could all be classified as individual based: super-individual models (Piscator, Charisma), physiologically structured models, stage-structured models and trait-based models. We briefly mention genetic algorithms, neural networks, Kalman filters and fuzzy logic. Thereafter, we zoom in, as an in-depth example, on the multi-decadal development and application of the lake ecosystem model PCLake and related models (PCLake Metamodel, Lake Shira Model, IPH-TRIM3D-PCLake). In the discussion, we argue that while the historical development of each approach and model is understandable given its ‘leading principle’, there are many opportunities for combining approaches. We take the point of view that a single ‘right’ approach does not exist and should not be strived for. Instead, multiple modelling approaches, applied concurrently to a given problem, can help develop an integrative view on the functioning of lake ecosystems. We end with a set of specific recommendations that may be of help in the further development of lake ecosystem models.},

	abstract = {Fine-scale measurements and temperature gradient microstructure data are used to describe the diurnal energetics of the mixed layer in the Wellington Reservoir in Western Australia. The data covered a morning period of solar heating, a period of severe wind mixing induced by an afternoon sea breeze, and a period of pure penetrative convection extending through most of the night. The Wedderburn number (W) ranged from a value of 0.02 at the start of the heating phase to a value of about 10 at the end of the convective period. During the intermediate strong wind period the value of W remained about 0.1; the surface wind stress induced a strong tilt of the isotherms at the base of the mixed layer. The other main parameter, the ratio of the Monin-Obukhov length to the depth of the mixed layer, ranged from about 5.0 during the morning down to 0.005 at the end of the convective period. The full range of mixed-layer deepening processes could thus be analyzed. A simple one-dimensional integral mixed-layer model was applied to assess the importance of the temporal terms in diurnal simulations and to verify the values of the energy conversion efficiencies used in such models. Overall, the model performed extremely well; however, the results showed the need to develop parameterizations for the energetics of billowing induced by large shears across the base of the mixed layer and for the mixing accompanying upwelling.},

	abstract = {The numerical model presented here is based on the one-dimensional equations for momentum, heat, salt, and turbulent kinetic energy integrated over the diurnal mixed layer. Two noteworthy features are the inclusion of the energetics of billowing due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the base of the mixed layer, and a closure hypothesis which retains average mixed-layer turbulent kinetic energy as an explicit variable, rather than assuming it to be a fixed proportion of external energy input. The importance of both these features is illustrated in the application of the model to the data for 1 day which included several mixing processes: a fairly calm morning with uninterrupted solar heating, followed by rapid mixed-layer deepening during a strong afternoon sea breeze, and finally a relatively cool night with little wind. The data contain rapidly changing meteorological inputs as well as evidence of strong billow formation and collapse and thus provide an ideal test of the importance of both billow energetics and the temporal effects in the turbulent kinetic energy budget. The model does not account for processes occurring below the mixed layer nor for the effects of horizontal advection. Within these constraints, model results agree well with measured temperatures and represent an improvement over the results of a slab model without billow energetics.},

The numbers are based on basin geometry, density stratification, wind stress, and rates of inflow and outflow. The procedure highlights the differences in the dynamics of the two lakes and allows assessment of the validity of the assumption of one-dimensionality. The result is that both lakes were dominated by one-dimensional, but different processes. The dynamics of the epilimnion of the smaller lake were dominated by stirring from surface wind and cooling, whereas shear at the pycnocline was also significant in the larger lake. In neither case did the effects of the earth’s rotation, inflow, or outflow generate significant horizontal gradients. A one-dimensional numerical model (DYRESM) was used to simulate the vertical temperature and salinity structures of both lakes over lengthy periods, with good results. The model is based on the parameterization of the important physical processes in a framework of horizontal layers of variable thickness and was applied in both lakes without alteration. The interpretative power of the model is demonstrated by examination of the formation and erosion of a thermal inversion in the larger lake.},

	abstract = {The African great lakes are of utmost importance for the local economy (fishing), as well as being essential to the survival of the local people. During the past decades, these lakes experienced fast changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, and their future evolution is a major concern. In this study, for the first time a set of one-dimensional lake models are evaluated for Lake Kivu (2.28°S; 28.98°E), East Africa. The unique limnology of this meromictic lake, with the importance of salinity and subsurface springs in a tropical high-altitude climate, presents a worthy challenge to the seven models involved in the Lake Model Intercomparison Project (LakeMIP). Meteorological observations from two automatic weather stations are used to drive the models, whereas a unique dataset, containing over 150 temperature profiles recorded since 2002, is used to assess the model's performance. Simulations are performed over the freshwater layer only (60 m) and over the average lake depth (240 m), since salinity increases with depth below 60 m in Lake Kivu and some lake models do not account for the influence of salinity upon lake stratification. All models are able to reproduce the mixing seasonality in Lake Kivu, as well as the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the lake enthalpy change. Differences between the models can be ascribed to variations in the treatment of the radiative forcing and the computation of the turbulent heat fluxes. Fluctuations in wind velocity and solar radiation explain inter-annual variability of observed water column temperatures. The good agreement between the deep simulations and the observed meromictic stratification also shows that a subset of models is able to account for the salinity- and geothermal-induced effects upon deep-water stratification. Finally, based on the strengths and weaknesses discerned in this study, an informed choice of a one-dimensional lake model for a given research purpose becomes possible.},

	abstract = {Many studies of future climate change take an ensemble modeling approach in which simulations of future conditions are produced with multiple climate models (or model versions), rather than just one. These ensemble studies are of two main types—perturbed-physics and multimodel—which investigate different sources of uncertainty about future climate change. Increasingly, methods are being applied which assign probabilities to future changes in climate on the basis of the set of projections (the ensemble) produced in a perturbed-physics or multimodel study. This has prompted debate over both the appropriate interpretation of ensembles as well as how best to communicate uncertainty about future climate change to decision makers; such communication is a primary impetus for ensemble studies. The intuition persists that agreement among ensemble members about the extent of future climate change warrants increased confidence in the projected changes, but in practice the significance of this robustness is difficult to gauge. Priority topics for future research include how to design ensemble studies that take better account of structural uncertainty, how to weight ensemble members and how to improve the process by which ensemble studies are synthesized with other information in expert assessments.

The investigated lake was Großer Kossenblatter See (Germany) as a representative of shallow, (2 m mean depth) turbid midlatitude lakes. Meteorological measurements, including turbulent fluxes and water temperature, were carried out by the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory of the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). Eight lake models of different complexity were run, forced by identical meteorological variables and model parameters unified as far as possible given different formulations of processes. All models generally captured diurnal and seasonal variability of lake surface temperature reasonably well. However, some models were incapable of realistically reproducing temperature stratification in summer. Total heat turbulent fluxes, computed by the surface flux schemes of the compared lake models, deviated on average from those measured by eddy covariance by 17–28 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. There are a number of possible reasons for these deviations, and the conclusion is drawn that underestimation of real fluxes by the eddy covariance technique is the most probable reason. It is supported by the fact that the eddy covariance fluxes do not allow to close the heat balance of the water column, the residual for the whole period considered being \&asymp;\&\#8211;28 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. The effect of heat flux to bottom sediments can become significant for bottom temperatures. It also has profound influence on the surface temperatures in autumn due to convective mixing but not in summer when the lake stratification is stable. Thus, neglecting sediments shifts the summer–autumn temperature difference in models lacking explicit treatment of sediments considerably. As a practical recommendation based on results of the present study, we also infer that in order to realistically represent lakes in numerical weather prediction and climate models, it is advisable to use depth-resolving turbulence models (or equivalent) in favor of models with a completely mixed temperature profile.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Complex ecological models are used to predict the consequences of anticipated future changes in climate and nutrient loading for lake water quality. These models may, however, suffer from nonuniqueness in that various sets of model parameter values may yield equally satisfactory representations of the system being modeled, but when applied in future scenarios these sets of values may divert considerably in their simulated outcomes. Compilation of an ensemble of model runs allows us to account for simulation variability arising from model parameter estimates. Thus, we propose a new approach for aquatic ecological models creating a more robust prediction of future water quality. We used our ensemble approach in an application of the widely used PCLake model for Danish shallow Lake Arreskov, which during the past two decades has demonstrated frequent shifts between turbid and clear water states. Despite marked variability, the span of our ensemble runs encapsulated 70–90\% of the observed variation in lake water quality. The model exercise demonstrates that future warming and increased nutrient loading lead to lower probability of a clear water, vegetation-rich state and greater likelihood of cyanobacteria dominance. In a 6.0°C warming scenario, for instance, the current nutrient loading of nitrogen and phosphorus must be reduced by about 75\% to maintain the present ecological state of Lake Arreskov, but even in a near-future 2.0°C warming scenario, a higher probability of a turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated state is predicted. As managers may wish to determine the probability of achieving a certain ecological state, our proposed ensemble approach facilitates new ways of communicating future stressor impacts.},

The fact that estimates of the current state are inaccurate and that numerical models have inadequacies, leads to forecast errors that grow with increasing forecast lead time. The growth of errors depends on the flow itself. Ensemble forecasting aims at quantifying this flow-dependent forecast uncertainty. The sources of uncertainty in weather forecasting are discussed. Then, an overview is given on evaluating probabilistic forecasts and their usefulness compared with single forecasts. Thereafter, the representation of uncertainties in ensemble forecasts is reviewed with an emphasis on the initial condition perturbations. The review is complemented by a detailed description of the methodology to generate initial condition perturbations of the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). These perturbations are based on the leading part of the singular value decomposition of the operator describing the linearised dynamics over a finite time interval. The perturbations are flow-dependent as the linearisation is performed with respect to a solution of the nonlinear forecast model. The extent to which the current ECMWF ensemble prediction system is capable of predicting flow-dependent variations in uncertainty is assessed for the large-scale flow in mid-latitudes.},

With this shift, comes the need to understand the current state of ensemble flood forecasting, in order to provide insights into current capabilities and areas for improvement, thus identifying future research opportunities to allow for better allocation of research resources. In this article, we provide an overview of current research activities in ensemble flood forecasting and discuss knowledge gaps and future research opportunities, based on a review of 70 papers focusing on various aspects of ensemble flood forecasting around the globe. Future research directions include opportunities to improve technical aspects of ensemble flood forecasting, such as data assimilation techniques and methods to account for more sources of uncertainty, and developing ensemble forecasts for more variables, for example, flood inundation, by applying techniques such as machine learning. Further to this, we conclude that there is a need to not only improve technical aspects of flood forecasting, but also to bridge the gap between scientific research and hydrometeorological model development, and real-world flood management using probabilistic ensemble forecasts, especially through effective communication.

We applied the single-model ensemble approach to the ecosystem model DYRESM–CAEDYM and Lake Kinneret, Israel. We introduced uncertainty to parameters and conducted an ensemble of simulations for three scenarios. Despite the large degree of uncertainty in parameter values the trends in ecosystem response were consistent with those observed based on calibrated parameter values. The variation in results allowed us to estimate the consequences of parameter uncertainty on lake resource management without the need for a comprehensive uncertainty analysis.},

To this end, three one-dimensional and a two-dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic model were set up. For the latter, the strength of the impacts with increasing distance from the dam was also investigated. Climate change effects were simulated by forcing the models with 150 years of synthetic meteorological time series created with a weather generator based on available air temperature scenarios for Switzerland. Future climate by the end of the 21st century was projected to shorten the ice-covered period by 2 months and decrease ice thicknesses by 13 cm. Under current climate conditions, the ice cover would already be affected by extended PS operation. For example, the average probability of ice coverage on a specific day was projected to decrease by 13\% for current climate and could further be reduced from 45\% to 10\% for future climate. Overall, the results of all models were consistent. Although the number of winters without ice cover was projected to increase for all one-dimensional models, studying individual segments of the two-dimensional model showed that the impact was pronounced for segments close to the PS intake/outlet. In summary, the reservoir's ice cover is expected to partially vanish with higher probability of open water conditions closer to the PS intake/outlet.},

Water quality MIP design should harmonize relevant model input datasets, use consistent spatial/temporal domains and resolutions, and similar output variables to improve understanding of water quality modelling uncertainties and provide harmonized water quality data that suit the needs of decision makers and other users.},

	abstract = {The physical dynamics of lake temperature and ice phenology are important in the modelling and management of temperate aquatic ecosystems. One-dimensional hydrothermal lake models have not been well evaluated in terms of how they simulate ice dynamics in particular. We chose four models (Hostetler, Minlake, Simple Ice Model or SIM and General Lake Model) to test and compare their performance modelling water temperature and ice dynamics using 16 years of field data from Harp Lake, an extensively studied inland lake in south-central Ontario. Each model produced satisfactory water temperature profiles over the simulated period, with small differences in the model performance. Model fits for ice phenology and ice thickness were, however, considerably lower than those for water temperature, with Minlake generating the best agreement with observed ice-on and ice-off dates as well as ice thickness, followed by SIM. The responses of lake ice dynamics to future climate scenarios were simulated by running each of the four models for 91 years, from 2010 to 2100. The predicted decrease in ice season length was significantly different among models, varying between 30 and 81 days, with an average of 48 days. Corresponding decreases in ice thickness varied between 0.11 and 0.20 m, averaging 0.17 m. This study demonstrates that uncertainty due to model performance and selection is considerable, and further testing and refinement of hydrothermal lake dynamic models are needed to improve predictive abilities for ice dynamics.

	abstract = {Abstract. In Paris, France, December 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide a "special report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways". In Nairobi, Kenya, April 2016, the IPCC panel accepted the invitation. Here we describe the response devised within the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) to provide tailored, cross-sectorally consistent impacts projections. The simulation protocol is designed to allow for (1) separation of the impacts of historical warming starting from pre-industrial conditions from other human drivers such as historical land-use changes (based on pre-industrial and historical impact model simulations); (2) quantification of the effects of additional warming up to 1.5 °C, including a potential overshoot and long-term effects up to 2299, compared to a no-mitigation scenario (based on the low-emissions Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6 and a no-mitigation pathway RCP6.0) with socio-economic conditions fixed at 2005 levels; and (3) assessment of the climate effects based on the same climate scenarios but accounting for simultaneous changes in socio-economic conditions following the middle-of-the-road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2, Fricko et al., 2016) and differential bio-energy requirements associated with the transformation of the energy system to comply with RCP2.6 compared to RCP6.0. With the aim of providing the scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across sectors and analysis of cross-sectoral interactions that may dampen or amplify sectoral impacts, the protocol is designed to facilitate consistent impacts projections from a range of impact models across different sectors (global and regional hydrology, global crops, global vegetation, regional forests, global and regional marine ecosystems and fisheries, global and regional coastal infrastructure, energy supply and demand, health, and tropical cyclones).},

Output from weather generators, on the other hand, can simulate short-term extreme conditions and weather patterns. In order to evaluate the likely impact of climate changes on a large sub-tropical lake, specifically the thermal regime of the lake, we constructed climate scenarios using a weather generator. The 30-year scenarios included no change in climate conditions, a gradual change, increased frequency of heat waves and a merging of the latter two. The projected impact on the lake\&rsquo;s physical properties was evaluated using an ensemble of 1-D hydrodynamic lake models. The gradual increase scenario had the largest impact on annual temperatures and stratification period; however, increased heat waves had a large effect on the summer lake conditions and introduced a larger degree of variability in water temperature. The use of the ensemble of models resulted in variability in the projected impacts; yet, the large degree of similarity between projected trends and patterns increased confidence in the results. The projected effect the heat waves will have on the lake conditions highlights the need to include heat waves in climate studies and the need for impact studies in order to better understand possible consequences for lake ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) was used to dynamically downscale two Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM) simulations of the transient climate change for the period 1950–2100, over North America, following the CORDEX protocol. The CRCM5 was driven by data from the CanESM2 and MPI-ESM-LR CGCM simulations, based on the historical (1850–2005) and future (2006–2100) RCP4.5 radiative forcing scenario. The results show that the CRCM5 simulations reproduce relatively well the current-climate North American regional climatic features, such as the temperature and precipitation multiannual means, annual cycles and temporal variability at daily scale. A cold bias was noted during the winter season over western and southern portions of the continent. CRCM5-simulated precipitation accumulations at daily temporal scale are much more realistic when compared with its driving CGCM simulations, especially in summer when small-scale driven convective precipitation has a large contribution over land. The CRCM5 climate projections imply a general warming over the continent in the 21st century, especially over the northern regions in winter. The winter warming is mostly contributed by the lower percentiles of daily temperatures, implying a reduction in the frequency and intensity of cold waves. A precipitation decrease is projected over Central America and an increase over the rest of the continent. For the average precipitation change in summer however there is little consensus between the simulations. Some of these differences can be attributed to the uncertainties in CGCM-projected changes in the position and strength of the Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure.},

These models may, however, suffer from nonuniqueness in that various sets of model parameter values may yield equally satisfactory representations of the system being modeled, but when applied in future scenarios these sets of values may divert considerably in their simulated outcomes. Compilation of an ensemble of model runs allows us to account for simulation variability arising from model parameter estimates. Thus, we propose a new approach for aquatic ecological models creating a more robust prediction of future water quality. We used our ensemble approach in an application of the widely used PCLake model for Danish shallow Lake Arreskov, which during the past two decades has demonstrated frequent shifts between turbid and clear water states. Despite marked variability, the span of our ensemble runs encapsulated 70–90\% of the observed variation in lake water quality. The model exercise demonstrates that future warming and increased nutrient loading lead to lower probability of a clear water, vegetation-rich state and greater likelihood of cyanobacteria dominance. In a 6.0°C warming scenario, for instance, the current nutrient loading of nitrogen and phosphorus must be reduced by about 75\% to maintain the present ecological state of Lake Arreskov, but even in a near-future 2.0°C warming scenario, a higher probability of a turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated state is predicted. As managers may wish to determine the probability of achieving a certain ecological state, our proposed ensemble approach facilitates new ways of communicating future stressor impacts.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The ability of the one-dimensional lake model FLake to represent the mixolimnion temperatures for tropical conditions was tested for three locations in East Africa: Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika's northern and southern basins. Meteorological observations from surrounding automatic weather stations were corrected and used to drive FLake, whereas a comprehensive set of water temperature profiles served to evaluate the model at each site. Careful forcing data correction and model configuration made it possible to reproduce the observed mixed layer seasonality at Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika (northern and southern basins), with correct representation of both the mixed layer depth and water temperatures. At Lake Kivu, mixolimnion temperatures predicted by FLake were found to be sensitive both to minimal variations in the external parameters and to small changes in the meteorological driving data, in particular wind velocity. In each case, small modifications may lead to a regime switch, from the correctly represented seasonal mixed layer deepening to either completely mixed or permanently stratified conditions from {\textasciitilde} 10 m downwards. In contrast, model temperatures were found to be robust close to the surface, with acceptable predictions of near-surface water temperatures even when the seasonal mixing regime is not reproduced. FLake can thus be a suitable tool to parameterise tropical lake water surface temperatures within atmospheric prediction models. Finally, FLake was used to attribute the seasonal mixing cycle at Lake Kivu to variations in the near-surface meteorological conditions. It was found that the annual mixing down to 60 m during the main dry season is primarily due to enhanced lake evaporation and secondarily to the decreased incoming long wave radiation, both causing a significant heat loss from the lake surface and associated mixolimnion cooling.},

GLM was developed to support the science needs of the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), a network of researchers using sensors to understand lake functioning and address questions about how lakes around the world respond to climate and land use change. The scale and diversity of lake types, locations, and sizes, and the expanding observational datasets created the need for a robust community model of lake dynamics with sufficient flexibility to accommodate a range of scientific and management questions relevant to the GLEON community. This paper summarizes the scientific basis and numerical implementation of the model algorithms, including details of sub-models that simulate surface heat exchange and ice cover dynamics, vertical mixing, and inflow–outflow dynamics. We demonstrate the suitability of the model for different lake types that vary substantially in their morphology, hydrology, and climatic conditions. GLM supports a dynamic coupling with biogeochemical and ecological modelling libraries for integrated simulations of water quality and ecosystem health, and options for integration with other environmental models are outlined. Finally, we discuss utilities for the analysis of model outputs and uncertainty assessments, model operation within a distributed cloud-computing environment, and as a tool to support the learning of network participants.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The impact of air temperature rise is eminent for the large deep lakes in the Italian subalpine district, climate change being caused there by both natural phenomena and anthropogenic greenhouse-gases (GHG) emissions. These oligomictic lakes are experiencing a decrease in the frequency of winter full turnover and an intensification of stability. As a result, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations are decreasing and nutrients are accumulating in bottom water, with effects on the whole ecosystem functioning. Forecasting the future evolution of the mixing pattern is relevant to assess if a reduction in GHG releases would be able to revert such processes. The study focuses on Lake Maggiore, for which the thermal structure evolution under climate change in the 2016–2085 period was assessed through numerical simulations, performed with the General Lake Model (GLM). Different prospects of regional air temperature rise were considered, given by the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario to obtain robust statistical predictions, adopting random series of meteorological data produced with the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG). Results show that a reversion in the increasing thermal stability would be possible only if global GHG emissions started to be reduced by {\textasciitilde} 2020, allowing an equilibrium mixing regime to be restored by the end of the twenty-first century. Otherwise, persistent lack of complete-mixing, severe water warming and extensive effects on water quality are to be expected for the centuries to come. These projections can be extended to the other lakes in the subalpine district.},

In this study, we present the calibration and validation of the newest version of the open-source hydrodynamic model GLM (General Lake Model) to the dimictic Lake Ammersee, located in south-east Germany. The simulation of lake water temperatures for the calibration period revealed an overall root mean square error of 0.65 °C and a mean error of 0.08 °C. The seasonal stratification pattern and the annual thermal structure of this dimictic lake were reproduced by the model. The model simulated the presence of winter ice cover for the only year out of 8 years simulated, when ice cover was observed. Elevated lake water temperatures were also reproduced in model simulations during a period in 2003 of unusually high air temperatures. Statistical analysis of the model calibration results for Lake Ammersee indicates a fit comparable to or better than most other well-established hydrodynamic models and provides an opportunity for continuous simulations through periods of ice cover. Our results indicate a major improvement in GLM compared with earlier model versions and demonstrate the applicability of GLM for limnophysical studies, particularly for altered forcing conditions such as climate change.},

	abstract = {Sustainable management of drinking water reservoirs requires balancing the demands of water supply whilst minimizing environmental impact. This study numerically simulates the effect of an improved withdrawal scheme designed to alleviate the temperature pollution downstream of a reservoir. The aim was to identify an optimal withdrawal strategy such that water of a desirable discharge temperature can be supplied downstream without leading to unacceptably low oxygen concentrations within the reservoir. First, we calibrated a one-dimensional numerical model for hydrodynamics and oxygen dynamics (GLM-AED2), verifying that the model reproduced water temperatures and hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations accurately over a 5 year period. Second, the model was extended to include an adaptive withdrawal functionality, allowing for a prescribed withdrawal temperature to be found, with the potential constraint of hypolimnetic oxygen concentration. Scenario simulations on epi-/metalimnetic withdrawal demonstrate that the model is able to autonomously determine the best withdrawal height depending on the thermal structure and the hypolimnetic oxygen concentration thereby optimizing the ability to supply a desirable discharge temperature to the downstream river during summer. This new withdrawal strategy also increased the hypolimnetic raw water volume to be used for drinking water supply, but reduced the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the deep and cold water layers (hypolimnion). Implications of the results for reservoir management are discussed and the numerical model is provided for operators as a simple and efficient tool for optimizing the withdrawal strategy within different reservoir contexts.},

In years with increased wind speed, stratification duration and intensity were reduced. Episodic wind forcing by strong wind events are important determinants of thermal structure and can induce persisting shifts in the thermal structure that remain over the season until the next overturn. The results showed that reductions in stratification intensity were particularly distinct when the strong wind occurred in early summer. Strong wind events outside of this sensitive time window did not exert an important impact on the thermal dynamics of the reservoir.

	abstract = {Climate change, in particular the increase in air temperature, has been shown to influence lake thermal dynamics, with climatic warming resulting in higher surface temperatures, stronger stratification, and altered mixing regimes. Less studied is the influence on lake thermal dynamics of atmospheric stilling, the decrease in near-surface wind speed observed in recent decades. Here we use a lake model to assess the influence of atmospheric stilling, on lake thermal dynamics across the Northern Hemisphere. From 1980 to 2016, lake thermal responses to warming have accelerated as a result of atmospheric stilling. Lake surface temperatures and thermal stability have changed at respective rates of 0.33 and 0.38 °C/decade, with atmospheric stilling contributing 15\% and 27\% of the calculated changes, respectively. Atmospheric stilling also resulted in a lengthening of stratification, contributing 23\% of the calculated changes. Our results demonstrate that atmospheric stilling has influenced lake thermal responses to warming.},

	abstract = {Changes in meteorological patterns to drier conditions alter the hydrodynamic processes of reservoirs and can affect their thermal structure. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of a severe drought period on the hydrodynamics of a tropical reservoir. One-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling was applied from 2009 to 2016 to simulate the thermal dynamics of the highly drought-impacted Serra Azul reservoir, a drinking water supply reservoir located in southeast Brazil. After calibration (r = 0.91, root mean square error [RMSE] = 1.33 °C) and validation of the model (r = 0.87, RMSE = 2.06 °C), physical indicators were calculated to evaluate the stratification and mixing processes in the water column. Results showed that the reservoir hydrodynamics were affected by the drought period through an increase in mixing frequency and duration. Negative implications for water quality are expected, such as higher concentration of dissolved substances and nutrients and increased turbidity, salinity, and electrical conductivity, as observed in most lakes and reservoirs subjected to drought. Different water withdrawal scenarios were simulated, and a critical water withdrawal volume that could prevent drought impacts on the Serra Azul reservoir thermal regime was identified. This study indicates the need for managers to understand potential impacts of extreme meteorological events in reservoir dynamics, particularly when the reservoirs are part of drinking water systems.},

	abstract = {A modelling system for coupled physical–biogeochemical simulations in the water column is presented here. The physical model component allows for a number of different statistical turbulence closure schemes, ranging from simple algebraic closures to two-equation turbulence models with algebraic second-moment closures. The biogeochemical module consists of models which are based on a number of state variables represented by their ensemble averaged concentrations. Specific biogeochemical models may range from simple NPZ (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton) to complex ecosystem models. Recently developed modified Patankar solvers for ordinary differential equations allow for stable discretisations of the production and destruction terms guaranteeing conservative and non-negative solutions. The increased stability of these new solvers over explicit solvers is demonstrated for a plankton spring bloom simulation. The model system is applied to marine ecosystem dynamics the Northern North Sea and the Central Gotland Sea. Two different biogeochemical models are applied, a conservative nitrogen-based model to the North Sea, and a more complex model including an oxygen equation to the Baltic Sea, allowing for the reproduction of chemical processes under anoxic conditions. For both applications, earlier model results obtained with slightly different model setups could be basically reproduced. It became however clear that the choice for ecosystem model parameters such as maximum phytoplankton growth rates does strongly depend on the physical model parameters (such as turbulence closure models or external forcing).},

The General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) one-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate water temperature when using ISIMIP2b bias-corrected climate model projections as input. These projections have a daily time step, while lake model simulations are often forced at hourly or shorter time steps. Therefore, it was necessary to first test the ability of GOTM to simulate Lake Erken water temperature using daily vs hourly meteorological forcing data. In order to do this, three data sets were used to force the model as follows: (1) hourly measured data, (2) daily average data derived from the first data set, and (3) synthetic hourly data created from the daily data set using generalised regression artificial neural network methods. This last data set is developed using a method that could also be applied to the daily time step ISIMIP scenarios to obtain hourly model input if needed. The lake model was shown to accurately simulate Lake Erken water temperature when forced with either daily or synthetic hourly data. Long-term simulations forced with daily or synthetic hourly meteorological data suggest that by the late 21st century the lake will undergo clear changes in thermal structure. For the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario, namely RCP2.6, surface water temperature was projected to increase by 1.79 and 1.36\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C when the lake model was forced at daily and hourly resolutions respectively, and for RCP6.0 these increases were projected to be 3.08 and 2.31\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C. Changes in lake stability were projected to increase, and the stratification duration was projected to be longer by 13 and 11\&thinsp;d under RCP2.6 scenario and 22 and 18\&thinsp;d under RCP6.0 scenario for daily and hourly resolutions. Model changes in thermal indices were very similar when using either the daily or synthetic hourly forcing, suggesting that the original ISIMIP climate model projections at a daily time step can be sufficient for the purpose of simulating lake water temperature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis provide powerful means to enhance the performance of the models, to increase the transparency and credibility of the model results, and to allow the decision-maker to judge whether the model results are sufficiently accurate and precise to support decision-making or not. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of numerical models usually require hundreds, thousands, or even more, repeated model runs (e.g., in Monte Carlo simulation) as well as access to change the model parameters and variables on each model run. Consequently, many model codes, although widely used and well-formulated, are not well-suited for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis due to too long model execution time or due to lack of suitable interface to change model parameters and variables in an automated way. In this paper, we describe in details a lake model code, which aims to combine good simulation capabilities with efficient model execution time and easy application of numerical uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques. This model code is called MyLake (Multi-year Lake simulation model) and it is a one-dimensional process-based model code for simulation of daily vertical distribution of lake water temperature and thus density stratification, evolution of seasonal lake ice and snow cover, sediment–water interactions, and phosphorus-phytoplankton dynamics. After giving a detailed technical description of the different processes and algorithms included in the current version 1.2 of the MyLake model code, we present some results from a model application example including an Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (Extended FAST) sensitivity analysis and a simple Monte Carlo simulation based uncertainty analysis. Finally we discuss the performance of the MyLake code, especially in connection with numerical uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques.},

	abstract = {Rogoznica Lake is highly eutrophic marine system located on the Eastern Adriatic coast (43°32′N, 15°58′E). Because of the relatively small size (10,276m2) and depth (15m) it experiences strong natural and indirect anthropogenic influences. Dynamics within the lake is characterized by the extreme and highly variable environmental conditions (seasonal variations in salinity and temperature, water stratification and mixing, redox and euxinic conditions, concentrations of nutrients) which significantly influence the biology inside the lake. Due to the high phytoplankton activity, the upper part of the water column is well oxygenated, while hypoxia/anoxia usually occurs in the bottom layers. Anoxic part of the water column is characterized with high concentrations of sulfide (up to 5mM) and nutrients (NH4+ up to 315μM; PO43− up to 53μM; SiO44− up to 680μM) indicating the pronounced remineralization of the allochthonous organic matter, produced in the surface waters. The mixolimnion varies significantly within a season feeling effects of the Adriatic atmospheric and ocean dynamics (temperature, wind, heat fluxes, rainfall) which all affect the vertical stability and possibly induce vertical mixing and/or turnover. Seasonal vertical mixing usually occurs during the autumn/winter upon the breakdown of the stratification, injecting oxygen-rich water from the surface into the deeper layers. Depending on the intensity and duration of the vertical dynamics (slower diffusion and/or faster turnover of the water layers) anoxic conditions could developed within the whole water column. Extreme weather events such as abrupt change in the air temperature accompanied with a strong wind and consequently heat flux are found to be a key triggering mechanism for the fast turnover, introducing a large amount of nutrients and sulfur species from deeper parts to the surface. Increased concentration of nutrients, especially ammonium, phosphate, and silicates persisting for several months after the mixing event, together with anoxic stress conditions, additionally influence already stressed ecosystem, hence shifting the community structure and food/web interactions in this marine system.},

However, in most cases such records span a short period of time and/or are incomplete, providing a less credible assessment of change. In this study, the hydrodynamic GOTM (General Ocean Turbulence Model, a hydrodynamic model configured in lake mode) was used to reconstruct daily profiles of water temperature in Lake Erken (Sweden) over the period 1961–2017 using seven climatic parameters as forcing data: wind speed (WS), air temperature (Air {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{T}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}), atmospheric pressure (Air {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{P}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}), relative humidity (RH), cloud cover (CC), precipitation (DP), and shortwave radiation (SWR). The model was calibrated against observed water temperature data collected during the study interval, and the calibrated model revealed a good match between modelled and observed temperature (RMSE\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}=1.089{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C). From the long-term simulations of water temperature, this study focused on detecting possible trends in water temperature over the entire study interval 1961–2017 and in the sub-intervals 1961–1988 and 1989–2017, since an abrupt change in air temperature was detected in 1988.

Moreover, this study showed that changes in the phenology of thermal stratification have occurred over the 57-year period of study.

The duration of thermal stratification has increased by 7.297\&thinsp;d per decade, corresponding to an earlier onset of stratification of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼16{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;d and to a delay of stratification termination of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼26{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;d. The average thermocline depth during stratification became shallower by {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼1.345{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m, and surface-bottom temperature difference increased over time by 0.249\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C per decade. The creation of a daily time step water temperature dataset not only provided evidence of changes in Erken thermal structure over the last decades, but is also a valuable resource of information that can help in future research on the ecology of Lake Erken. The use of readily available meteorological data to reconstruct Lake Erken's past water temperature is shown to be a useful method to evaluate long-term changes in lake thermal structure, and it is a method that can be extended to other lakes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} One-dimensional hydrodynamic models are nowadays widely recognized as key tools for lake studies. They offer the possibility to analyze processes at high frequency, here referring to hourly timescales, to investigate scenarios and test hypotheses. Yet, simulation outputs are mainly used by the modellers themselves and often not easily reachable for the outside community. We have developed an open-access web-based platform for visualization and promotion of easy access to lake model output data updated in near-real time ({\textless}span class="uri"{\textgreater}http://simstrat.eawag.ch{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, last access: 29 August 2019). This platform was developed for 54 lakes in Switzerland with potential for adaptation to other regions or at global scale using appropriate forcing input data. The benefit of this data platform is practically illustrated with two examples. First, we show that the output data allows for assessing the long-term effects of past climate change on the thermal structure of a lake. The study confirms the need to not only evaluate changes in all atmospheric forcing but also changes in the watershed or throughflow heat energy and changes in light penetration to assess the lake thermal structure. Then, we show how the data platform can be used to study and compare the role of episodic strong wind events for different lakes on a regional scale and especially how their thermal structure is temporarily destabilized. With this open-access data platform, we demonstrate a new path forward for scientists and practitioners promoting a cross exchange of expertise through openly sharing in situ and model data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Results of a lake model intercomparison study conducted within the framework of Lake Model Intercomparison Project are presented. The investigated lake was Großer Kossenblatter See (Germany) as a representative of shallow, (2 m mean depth) turbid midlatitude lakes. Meteorological measurements, including turbulent fluxes and water temperature, were carried out by the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory of the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). Eight lake models of different complexity were run, forced by identical meteorological variables and model parameters unified as far as possible given different formulations of processes. All models generally captured diurnal and seasonal variability of lake surface temperature reasonably well. However, some models were incapable of realistically reproducing temperature stratification in summer. Total heat turbulent fluxes, computed by the surface flux schemes of the compared lake models, deviated on average from those measured by eddy covariance by 17–28 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. There are a number of possible reasons for these deviations, and the conclusion is drawn that underestimation of real fluxes by the eddy covariance technique is the most probable reason. It is supported by the fact that the eddy covariance fluxes do not allow to close the heat balance of the water column, the residual for the whole period considered being \&asymp;\&\#8211;28 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. The effect of heat flux to bottom sediments can become significant for bottom temperatures. It also has profound influence on the surface temperatures in autumn due to convective mixing but not in summer when the lake stratification is stable. Thus, neglecting sediments shifts the summer–autumn temperature difference in models lacking explicit treatment of sediments considerably. As a practical recommendation based on results of the present study, we also infer that in order to realistically represent lakes in numerical weather prediction and climate models, it is advisable to use depth-resolving turbulence models (or equivalent) in favor of models with a completely mixed temperature profile.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Low concentrations of dissolved oxygen remain a global concern regarding the ecological health of lakes and reservoirs. In addition to high nutrient loads, climate-induced changes in lake stratification and mixing represent additional anthropogenic menace resulting in decreased deepwater oxygen levels. The analysis of 43 years of monitoring data from Lake Geneva shows no decreasing trend neither in the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate nor in the extent of hypoxia. Instead, hypoxic conditions are predominantly controlled by deep mixing in winter and much less by the trophic variations over the past decades. To reproduce winter mixing, the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model SIMSTRAT was specially adapted to deep lakes and run for several climate scenarios. The simulations predicted a decrease in the maximum winter mixing depth from an average of ∼172 m for 1981–2012 to ∼136 m and ∼127 m in response to predicted atmospheric temperatures between 2045–2076 and 2070–2101 according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios. Concurrently, events with complete homogenization of temperature and oxygen in winter will decrease by ∼50\%. Consequently, the hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations will significantly decrease. These results demonstrate that changes in deep mixing can have stronger impact than eutrophication on the deepwater oxygen levels of oligomictic lakes.},

To improve sharing and reuse of published metabolism models, we developed LakeMetabolizer, an R package for estimating lake metabolism from in situ time series of dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and, optionally, additional environmental variables. LakeMetabolizer implements 5 different metabolism models with diverse statistical underpinnings: bookkeeping, ordinary least squares, maximum likelihood, Kalman filter, and Bayesian. Each of these 5 metabolism models can be combined with 1 of 7 models for computing the coefficient of gas exchange across the air–water interface (k). LakeMetabolizer also features a variety of supporting functions that compute conversions and implement calculations commonly applied to raw data prior to estimating metabolism (e.g., oxygen saturation and optical conversion models). These tools have been organized into an R package that contains example data, example use-cases, and function documentation. The release package version is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and the full open-source GPL-licensed code is freely available for examination and extension online. With this unified, open-source, and freely available package, we hope to improve access and facilitate the application of metabolism in studies and management of lentic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Background: Environmental health research employs a variety of metrics to measure heat exposure, both to directly study the health effects of outdoor temperature and to control for temperature in studies of other environmental exposures, including air pollution. To measure heat exposure, environmental health studies often use heat index, which incorporates both air temperature and moisture. However, the method of calculating heat index varies across environmental studies, which could mean that studies using different algorithms to calculate heat index may not be comparable.Objective and Methods: We investigated 21 separate heat index algorithms found in the literature to determine a) whether different algorithms generate heat index values that are consistent with the theoretical concepts of apparent temperature and b) whether different algorithms generate similar heat index values.Results: Although environmental studies differ in how they calculate heat index values, most studies’ heat index algorithms generate values consistent with apparent temperature. Additionally, most different algorithms generate closely correlated heat index values. However, a few algorithms are potentially problematic, especially in certain weather conditions (e.g., very low relative humidity, cold weather). To aid environmental health researchers, we have created open-source software in R to calculate the heat index using the U.S. National Weather Service’s algorithm.Conclusion: We identified 21 separate heat index algorithms used in environmental research. Our analysis demonstrated that methods to calculate heat index are inconsistent across studies. Careful choice of a heat index algorithm can help ensure reproducible and consistent environmental health research.Citation: Anderson GB, Bell ML, Peng RD. 2013.

	abstract = {Boreal lakes are impacted by climate change, reduced acid deposition, and changing loads of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from catchments. We explored, using the process-based lake model MyLake, how changes in these pressures modulate ice phenology and the dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) of a small boreal humic lake. The model was parametrized against year-round time series of water temperature and DO from a lake buoy. Observed trends in air temperature (+0.045°C yr−1) and DOC concentration (0.11 mg C L−1 yr−1, +1\% annually) over the past 40 years were used as model forcings. A backcast of ice freezing and breakup dates revealed that ice breakup occurred on average 8 days earlier in 2014 than in 1974. The earlier ice breakup enhanced water column ventilation resulting in higher DO in the spring. Warmer water in late summer led to longer anoxic periods, as microbial DOC turnover increased. A long-term increase in DOC concentrations caused a decline in lake DO, leading to 15\% more hypoxic days ({\textless}3 mg L−1) and 10\% more anoxic days ({\textless}15 µg L−1) in 2014 than in 1974. We conclude that climate warming and increasing DOC loads are antagonistic with respect to their effect on DO availability. The model suggests that DOC is a stronger driver of DO consumption than temperature. The browning of lakes may thus cause reductions in the oxythermal habitat of fish and aquatic biota in boreal lakes.},

scales and purposes for model development. Despite the heterogeneous nature of this data set, we were able to identify model behavior trends and illuminate aspects of current modeling practice that need to be reevaluated. Temperature and dissolved oxygen
had the highest coefficients of determination (respective median r2 values were 0.93 and 0.70) and the lowest relative error (median RE {\textless} 10\%), nutrients and phytoplankton had intermediate predictability (median r2 values

model complexity did not improve fit. Aquatic biogeochemical modelers need to be more consistent in how they apply conventional methodological steps during model development (i.e. sensitivity analysis, validation), and the aquatic modeling community
should adopt generally accepted standards of model performance. Recent advancements in data assimilation techniques, the combination of the present family of models with goal functions (derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the development of
models with a stronger physiological basis are promising frameworks for obtaining more accurate simulations of planktonic processes.},

Although a large number of lakes across the globe are systematically monitored, it is rare to have a wide range of ecological indices measured at high enough frequency and over a sufficient time scale to allow characterisation of the response of a lake ecosystem to such events. We present data from Lough Feeagh, a relatively large oligotrophic lake in Ireland, which was at the epicentre of a once in 250-year precipitation event in July 2009 when 50 mm of rain fell in less than 2 hours. The effects of the resulting flood on the water column stability, chemistry, biology, and metabolism were examined, and data from multiple years before and after the event were used to ascertain the significance and longevity of any observed changes. The flood caused the water column to destabilise prematurely and depressed primary production. Bacterial biomass was high in the month after the flood, and zooplankton assemblages in late 2009 were significantly different from those of other years. Changes in all these variables combined to produce lower rates of gross primary production and higher rates of respiration than those measured between 2010 and 2014, resulting in more pronounced negative net ecosystem production than in the other years. Despite all these changes, the normal seasonal cycles resumed in 2010, and it appears that this rare but significant event did not have a long-term impact on the ecosystem functioning of the lake.},

The area receives acid precipitation (weighted average pH 4.28).

The sulfate budgets (which include estimated dry deposit) indicate that the terrestrial catchment retains about 20\% of the incoming sulfate, perhaps due to absorption in the soil, plant uptake, reduction and storage in peaty areas or reduction and release of H2S to the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {We examined the factors that determine the citations of 153 mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical modeling papers published from 1990 to 2002. Our analysis provides overwhelming evidence that ocean modeling is a dynamic area of the current modeling practice. Models developed to gain insight into the ocean carbon cycle/marine biogeochemistry are most highly cited, the produced knowledge is exported to other cognitive disciplines, and oceanic modelers are less reluctant to embrace technical advances (e.g., assimilation schemes) and more critically increase model complexity. Contrary to our predictions, model application for environmental management issues on a local scale seems to have languished; the pertinent papers comprise a smaller portion of the published modeling literature and receive lower citations. Given the critical planning information that these models aim to provide, we hypothesize that the latter finding probably stems from conceptual weaknesses, methodological omissions, and an evident lack of haste from modelers to adopt new ideas in their repertoire when addressing environmental management issues. We also highlight the lack of significant association between citation frequency and model complexity, model performance, implementation of conventional methodological steps during model development (e.g., validation, sensitivity analysis), number of authors, and country of affiliation. While these results cast doubt on the rationale of the current modeling practice, the fact that the Fasham et al. (1990) paper has received over 400 citations probably dictates what should be done from the modeling community to meet the practical need for attractive and powerful modeling tools.},

	abstract = {The fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) was used to dynamically downscale two Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM) simulations of the transient climate change for the period 1950–2100, over North America, following the CORDEX protocol. The CRCM5 was driven by data from the CanESM2 and MPI-ESM-LR CGCM simulations, based on the historical (1850–2005) and future (2006–2100) RCP4.5 radiative forcing scenario. The results show that the CRCM5 simulations reproduce relatively well the current-climate North American regional climatic features, such as the temperature and precipitation multiannual means, annual cycles and temporal variability at daily scale. A cold bias was noted during the winter season over western and southern portions of the continent. CRCM5-simulated precipitation accumulations at daily temporal scale are much more realistic when compared with its driving CGCM simulations, especially in summer when small-scale driven convective precipitation has a large contribution over land. The CRCM5 climate projections imply a general warming over the continent in the 21st century, especially over the northern regions in winter. The winter warming is mostly contributed by the lower percentiles of daily temperatures, implying a reduction in the frequency and intensity of cold waves. A precipitation decrease is projected over Central America and an increase over the rest of the continent. For the average precipitation change in summer however there is little consensus between the simulations. Some of these differences can be attributed to the uncertainties in CGCM-projected changes in the position and strength of the Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure.},

	abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are experiencing greater variability due to human activities, necessitating new tools to anticipate future water quality. In response, we developed and deployed a real-time iterative water temperature forecasting system (FLARE—Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems). FLARE is composed of water temperature and meteorology sensors that wirelessly stream data, a data assimilation algorithm that uses sensor observations to update predictions from a hydrodynamic model and calibrate model parameters, and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to generate forecasts that include uncertainty. Importantly, FLARE quantifies the contribution of different sources of uncertainty (driver data, initial conditions, model process, and parameters) to each daily forecast of water temperature at multiple depths. We applied FLARE to Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), a drinking water supply, during a 475-day period encompassing stratified and mixed thermal conditions. Aggregated across this period, root mean square error (RMSE) of daily forecasted water temperatures was 1.13°C at the reservoir's near-surface (1.0 m) for 7-day ahead forecasts and 1.62°C for 16-day ahead forecasts. The RMSE of forecasted water temperatures at the near-sediments (8.0 m) was 0.87°C for 7-day forecasts and 1.20°C for 16-day forecasts. FLARE successfully predicted the onset of fall turnover 4–14 days in advance in two sequential years. Uncertainty partitioning identified meteorology driver data as the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts for most depths and thermal conditions, except for the near-sediments in summer, when model process uncertainty dominated. Overall, FLARE provides an open-source system for lake and reservoir water quality forecasting to improve real-time management.},

Despite the importance of this heat budget, heat uptake by inland waters has so far not been quantified.

The total net heat uptake by inland waters amounts to 2.6 ± 3.2 ×1020 J over the period 1900–2020, corresponding to 3.6\% of the energy stored on land. The overall uptake is dominated by natural lakes (111.7\%), followed by reservoir warming (2.3\%). Rivers contribute negatively (-14\%) due to a decreasing water volume. The thermal energy of water stored in artificial reservoirs exceeds inland water heat uptake by a factor ∼10.4. This first quantification underlines that the heat uptake by inland waters is relatively small, but non-negligible.},

In Nairobi, Kenya, April 2016, the IPCC panel accepted the invitation. Here we describe the response devised within the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) to provide tailored, cross-sectorally consistent impact projections to broaden the scientific basis for the report. The simulation protocol is designed to allow for (1) separation of the impacts of historical warming starting from pre-industrial conditions from impacts of other drivers such as historical land-use changes (based on pre-industrial and historical impact model simulations); (2) quantification of the impacts of additional warming up to 1.5 °C, including a potential overshoot and long-term impacts up to 2299, and comparison to higher levels of global mean temperature change (based on the low-emissions Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6 and a no-mitigation pathway RCP6.0) with socio-economic conditions fixed at 2005 levels; and (3) assessment of the climate effects based on the same climate scenarios while accounting for simultaneous changes in socio-economic conditions following the middle-of-the-road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2, Fricko et al., 2016) and in particular differential bioenergy requirements associated with the transformation of the energy system to comply with RCP2.6 compared to RCP6.0. With the aim of providing the scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across sectors and analysis of cross-sectoral interactions that may dampen or amplify sectoral impacts, the protocol is designed to facilitate consistent impact projections from a range of impact models across different sectors (global and regional hydrology, lakes, global crops, global vegetation, regional forests, global and regional marine ecosystems and fisheries, global and regional coastal infrastructure, energy supply and demand, temperature-related mortality, and global terrestrial biodiversity).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Lake Hallstättersee is a holomictic alpine lake, which is influenced by salt mining since the middle Bronze Age. Beside the constant saline waste water load, two massive brine spills loaded the lake with additional 16,900 tons sodium chloride (≈10,250 tons Cl−) from 1977 to 1979 and 3,000 tons salt (≈1,820 tons Cl−) in 2005. The effect of waste water intrusions from salt mining on stratification of Lake Hallstättersee was analysed over a period of 40 years. Water density, dissolved oxygen and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were measured and an exponential model was fitted to describe the wash-out of chloride from Lake Hallstättersee after the brine spills. Furthermore, the time required returning to holomixis and steady chloride content after the second brine spill was estimated. During the whole sampling period the minimum and maximum volume-weighted annual mean chloride concentrations were 23.58 mg/L in 1979 and 3.19 mg/L in 1998. However, the mixing regime of Lake Hallstättersee, as well as the chloride concentrations, varied considerably and exhibited three holomictic and three meromictic periods between 1970 and 2009. Holomictic periods were observed when the yearly density gradient was below 0.06 kg/m3, deepwater oxygen in spring above 4 mg/L and consequently declining TP concentration in the deepest water layer below 60 mg/m3, otherwise meromictic periods were observed. Our study showed that Hallstättersee was 13 years ectogenic meromictic and 27 years holomictic during the study period.},

Salt concentrations measured in 8 streams between 2007 and 2009 ranging in development from pristine to moderate resulted in 4 significantly different groups based on chloride concentrations. Chloride concentrations were significantly correlated to the amount of roadway surface within each sub-watershed, with chloride concentrations in the most impacted stream approaching 200 mg/L. In the more impacted streams, chlor­ide concentrations were significantly and inversely correlated to discharge rate. The high road density around the more developed south end accounted for ∼30\% of the estimated road salt application, which created a chloride gradient within the lake that decreased as water flowed north to the single outlet. The continual and disproportionate input of road salt near the southern end of the lake strengthened the gradient over time to create 4 significantly different regions within the lake. While the consistent lake-wide increase seems to be open-ended, a steady-state salt concentration within the lake may occur in the near future. Based on change of lake chloride mass and export from the lake (2007–2009), an average lake-wide steady-state chloride concentration of ∼17 mg/L is expected, with some variation anticipated due to interannual variation in precipitation and the salt gradient within the lake.},

	abstract = {Saline emissions can elevate water densities and have the potential to alter stratification and mixing dynamics in lakes. In the light of rising anthropogenic salinization of temperate freshwater lakes, it is highly relevant to understand how saline emissions, as well as the rehabilitation from salt pollution might affect lake circulation patterns. In this study, we present the impact of industrial pollution with chloride salts on the deep Alpine lake Traunsee in Austria from 1930 to 2005 and the observed limnological changes during the recovery from salinization in the following 12 years. We assembled and analysed a unique dataset of monthly sampling profiles covering chloride, conductivity, temperature and dissolved oxygen over a 87-year period. We quantified the impact of saline emissions on the lake’s total chloride content, water densities, stability indices and deepwater oxygen concentrations. Time-series of water density profiles and stability indices revealed a significant impact of salinization on seasonal stratification and mixing. Higher dilution and shallower release of saline wastes and the short water retention in Traunsee helped to prevent a long-lasting density stratification. Nevertheless, two periods of salt-induced meromixis occurred in the lake. The first was caused directly by the disposal of saline wastes into the deepwater in the 1930s and 1940s, whereas the second was induced by the recovery from salinization in recent years. The naturally faster wash-out of salts from shallower water layers reinforced the density gradient and impeded vertical water circulation after salt pollution ceased. The rehabilitation from salinization had a stronger effect on stratification intensity and deepwater oxygen concentration than the continuous salt pollution over the last century.},

	abstract = {Meromixis in temperate freshwater lakes is in most cases caused by (1) a morphometric predisposition combined with a high productivity that leads to anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion, (2) saline subsurface inflows, or (3) turbidity currents. Here we report an unusual case where meromixis is caused by the surface inflow of a small tributary. Lej da San Murezzan has been known for several decades to be salinity-stratified during winter, contrary to its neighbouring lakes Lej da Silvaplauna and Lej da Segl. To determine the cause of this stratification, vertical profiles of conductivity were measured on ten occasions between 27 September 2006 and 23 March 2007. An evaluation of these profiles showed that the salinity stratification was continuously built up by a salt source of approximately 5 t d-1. Ovel dal Mulin, a small tributary that contributes only about 1\% to the total water inflows of the lake, was identified as the source of this salt. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a lake where such a small unpolluted surface inflow leads to almost permanent salinity stratification. The salinity stratification has important consequences: it causes the lake to be meromictic with only occasional complete mixing instead of dimictic as the neighbouring lakes and thus supports the build-up of an anoxic bottom layer. Furthermore, it allows restratifying the cold water discharge from a recently installed heat pump within the hypolimnion without the risk of disturbing the ice formation at the lake surface by a rising plume.},

	abstract = {The highest densities of lakes on Earth are in north temperate ecosystems, where increasing urbanization and associated chloride runoff can salinize freshwaters and threaten lake water quality and the many ecosystem services lakes provide. However, the extent to which lake salinity may be changing at broad spatial scales remains unknown, leading us to first identify spatial patterns and then investigate the drivers of these patterns. Significant decadal trends in lake salinization were identified using a dataset of long-term chloride concentrations from 371 North American lakes. Landscape and climate metrics calculated for each site demonstrated that impervious land cover was a strong predictor of chloride trends in Northeast and Midwest North American lakes. As little as 1\% impervious land cover surrounding a lake increased the likelihood of long-term salinization. Considering that 27\% of large lakes in the United States have {\textgreater}1\% impervious land cover around their perimeters, the potential for steady and long-term salinization of these aquatic systems is high. This study predicts that many lakes will exceed the aquatic life threshold criterion for chronic chloride exposure (230 mg L
              −1
              ), stipulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the next 50 y if current trends continue.},

Extremely elevated conductivity, chloride, sodium, and potassium levels are observed in the urban Asylum and Woods Lakes compared to the rural Brewster Lake, presumably due to runoff of road salt deicers applied in the surrounding watershed.

The original analysis predicted a rapid increase in chloride concentrations before reaching a steady steady of 8 mg L−1 by 2020. Forty years of monitoring Sparkling Lake show that rather than reaching a dynamic equilibrium, chloride concentrations have steadily increased. We update the original box model approach by adding a soil reservoir component that shows the slow steady rise in chloride is the result of terrestrial retention. For freshwater rivers and lakes, chloride retention on the landscape will both delay chloride impairment and prolong recovery and must be considered when modeling future chloride contamination risk.},

Because of their long residence times, lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron exhibit persistent increases in most ions. For lakes Erie and Ontario, several ions (chloride, sodium, calcium and sulfate), as well as specific conductance, reached peak levels between 1965 and 1975, but then began to decline. The decreases are attributable to different mechanisms: industrial point discharge reductions (sodium, chloride), atmospheric loading declines (sulfate), and the introduction of exotic dreissenid mussels (calcium). Recent data indicate that these ions are now increasing again (chloride, sodium) or have leveled off (calcium, sulfate). The results establish how much the chemical makeup of the Great Lakes has changed due to anthropogenic influences, and underscore the importance of long-term, systematic, water-quality monitoring. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {Influxes of saline water from roads treated with deicers can alter the density structure of urban lakes. This can diminish or halt turnover events, such that lakes may transition from dimixis to monomixis or meromixis. In nutrient-rich lakes, this lack of turnover can produce persistent hypolimnetic anoxia. We hypothesized that diminished turnover in urban lakes impacted by road salt inputs would lead to increased accumulation of methane in the hypolimnia, with the potential for greater release of methane to the atmosphere via ebullition and from larger storage fluxes of methane when turnover events do occur. The lake water columns of two urban lakes (Woods Lake and Asylum Lake), previously suggested to have transitioned to meromixis and monomixis because of road salt deicer inputs, were sampled monthly from March 2016 to June 2017. A nearby rural lake (North Lake) less likely to be impacted by road salt and maintaining seasonal mixing, was also sampled for comparison. Lake column water was analyzed for conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ferrous iron, manganese, sulfide, calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride and methane concentrations as a function of depth. All three lakes are eutrophic with at least seasonally anoxic hypolimnia. Our data are consistent with prior studies suggesting that Woods Lake has transitioned to meromixis and Asylum Lake to monomixis due to an influx of dense saline water from roads treated with deicers. In contrast, rural North Lake, which had much lower chloride, sodium and conductivity levels, was dimictic. The diminished or absent turnover in the two urban lakes during fall and spring resulted in persistently anoxic, redox-stratified hypolimnia, with much larger accumulations of methane compared to the rural lake. This study demonstrates that road salt deicers impact lake mixing and biogeochemistry, especially methane concentrations, with the potential for significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions from urban lakes.},

	abstract = {Chloride concentrations in northern U.S. included in this study have increased substantially over time with average concentrations approximately doubling from 1990 to 2011, outpacing the rate of urbanization in the northern U.S. Historical data were examined for 30 monitoring sites on19 streams that had chloride concentration and flow records of 18 to 49 years. Chloride concentrations in most studied streams increased in all seasons (13 of 19 in all seasons; 16 of 19 during winter); maximum concentrations occurred during winter. Increasing concentrations during non-deicing periods suggest that chloride was stored in hydrologic reservoirs, such as the shallow groundwater system, during the winter and slowly released in baseflow throughout the year. Streamflow dependency was also observed with chloride concentrations increasing as streamflow decreased, a result of dilution during rainfall- and snowmelt-induced high-flow periods. The influence of chloride on aquatic life increased with time; 29\% of sites studied exceeded the concentration for the USEPA chronic water quality criteria of 230mg/L by an average of more than 100 individual days per year during 2006–2011. The rapid rate of chloride concentration increase in these streams is likely due to a combination of possible increased road salt application rates, increased baseline concentrations, and greater snowfall in the Midwestern U.S. during the latter portion of the study period.},

Anthropogenic sources of chloride in a lake catchment, including road salt, fertilizer, and wastewater, can elevate the chloride concentration in freshwater lakes above background levels. Rising chloride concentrations can impact lake ecology and ecosystem services such as fisheries and the use of lakes as drinking water sources. To analyze the spatial extent and magnitude of increasing chloride concentrations in freshwater lakes, we amassed a database of 529 lakes in Europe and North America that had greater than or equal to ten years of chloride data. For each lake, we calculated climate statistics of mean annual total precipitation and mean monthly air temperatures from gridded global datasets. We also quantified land cover metrics, including road density and impervious surface, in buffer zones of 100 to 1,500 m surrounding the perimeter of each lake. This database represents the largest global collection of lake chloride data. We hope that long-term water quality measurements in areas outside Europe and North America can be added to the database as they become available in the future.},

	abstract = {The application of road deicing salts has led to the salinization of freshwater ecosystems in northern regions worldwide. Increased chloride concentrations in lakes, streams, ponds, and wetlands may negatively affect freshwater biota, potentially threatening ecosystem services. In an effort to reduce the effects of road salt, operators have increased the use of salt alternatives, yet we lack an understanding of how these deicers affect aquatic communities. We examined the direct and indirect effects of the most commonly used road salt (NaCl) and a proprietary salt mixture (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2), at three environmentally relevant concentrations (150, 470, and 780 mg Cl−/L) on freshwater wetland communities in combination with one of three biotic stressors (control, predator cues, and competitors). The communities contained periphyton, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and two tadpole species (American toads, Anaxyrus americanus; wood frogs, Lithobates sylvaticus). Overall, we found the two road salts did not interact with the natural stressors. Both salts decreased pH and reduced zooplankton abundance. The strong decrease in zooplankton abundance in the highest NaCl concentration caused a trophic cascade that resulted in increased phytoplankton abundance. The highest NaCl concentration also reduced toad activity. For the biotic stressors, predatory stress decreased whereas competitive stress increased the activity of both tadpole species. Wood frog survival, time to metamorphosis, and mass at metamorphosis all decreased under competitive stress whereas toad time to metamorphosis increased and mass at metamorphosis decreased. Road salts and biotic stressors can both affect freshwater communities, but their effects are not interactive.},

Calcium, magnesium, sodium, alkalinity, and hardness significantly increased in the drinking water supply for Baltimore, Maryland over almost 50 years (p {\textless} 0.05) coinciding with regional urbanization. Across a nearby land use gradient at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, there were significant increases in concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, SO42−, Si, and pH with increasing impervious surfaces in 9 streams monitored bi-weekly over a 3–4 year period (p {\textless} 0.05). Base cations in urban streams were up to 60 times greater than forest and agricultural streams, and elemental ratios suggested road salt and carbonate weathering from impervious surfaces as potential sources. Laboratory weathering experiments with concrete also indicated that impervious surfaces increased pH and DIC with potential to alkalinize urban waters. Ratios of Na+ and Cl− suggested that there was enhanced ion exchange in the watersheds from road salts, which could mobilize other base cations from soils to streams. There were significant relationships between Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+ concentrations and Cl−, SO42-, NO3− and DIC across land use (p {\textless} 0.05), which suggested tight coupling of geochemical cycles. Finally, concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, DIC, and pH significantly increased with distance downstream (p {\textless} 0.05) along a stream network draining 170 km2 of the Baltimore LTER site contributing to river alkalinization. Our results suggest that urbanization can dramatically increase major ions, ionic strength, and pH over decades from headwaters to coastal zones, which can impact integrity of aquatic life, infrastructure, drinking water, and coastal ocean alkalinization.},

We show that salinization and alkalinization are linked, and trends in these processes impact most of the drainage area of the United States. Increases in salinity and alkalinity are caused by inputs of salts containing strong bases and carbonates that originate from anthropogenic sources and accelerated weathering.

Mean annual chloride concentration increased as a function of impervious surface and exceeded tolerance for freshwater life in suburban and urban watersheds.

	abstract = {Over 317,000 tonnes of road salt (NaCl) are applied annually for road deicing in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA) of Minnesota. Although road salt is applied to increase driving safety, this practice influences environmental water quality. Thirteen lakes in the TCMA were studied over 46 months to determine if and how they respond to the seasonal applications of road salt. Sodium and chloride concentrations in these lakes were 10 and 25 times higher, respectively, than in other non-urban lakes in the region. Seasonal salinity/chloride cycles in the lakes were correlated with road salt applications: High concentrations in the winter and spring, especially near the bottom of the lakes, were followed by lower concentrations in the summer and fall due to flushing of the lakes by rainfall runoff. The seasonal salt storage/flushing rates for individual lakes were derived from volume-weighted average chloride concentration time series. The rate ranged from 9 to 55\% of a lake's minimum salt content. In some of the lakes studied salt concentrations were high enough to stop spring turnover preventing oxygen from reaching the benthic sediments. Concentrations above the sediments were also high enough to induce convective mixing of the saline water into the sediment pore water. A regional analysis of historical water quality records of 38 lakes in the TCMA showed increases in lake salinity from 1984 to 2005 that were highly correlated with the amount of rock salt purchased by the State of Minnesota. Chloride concentrations in individual lakes were positively correlated with the percent of impervious surfaces in the watershed and inversely with lake volume. Taken together, the results show a continuing degradation of the water quality of urban lakes due to application of NaCl in their watersheds.},

We have characterized the most prevalent natural and anthropogenic sources of Na+ and Cl- in ground water, primarily in Illinois, and explored techniques that could be used to identify their source. We considered seven potential sources that included agricultural chemicals, septic effluent, animal waste, municipal landfill leachate, sea water, basin brines, and road deicers. The halides Cl-, bromide (Br), and iodide (I) were useful indicators of the sources of Na+-Cl- contamination. Iodide enrichment (relative to Cl-) was greatest in precipitation, followed by uncontaminated soil water and ground water, and landfill leachate. The mass ratios of the halides among themselves, with total nitrogen (N), and with Na+ provided diagnostic methods for graphically distinguishing among sources of Na+ and Cl- in contaminated water. Cl/Br ratios relative to Cl- revealed a clear, although overlapping, separation of sample groups. Samples of landfill leachate and ground water known to be contaminated by leachate were enriched in I and Br; this provided an excellent fingerprint for identifying leachate contamination. In addition, total N, when plotted against Cl/Br ratios, successfully separated water contaminated by road salt from water contaminated by other sources.},

	abstract = {Chloride pollution of groundwater and surface water resources is an environmental concern in many regions. While use of road salt for winter road maintenance is known to be a major source of chloride in the environment, limited research has investigated the environmental impacts of chloride discharged from water softeners, particularly in areas with hard water. A chloride budget was developed for the state of Minnesota to estimate the amount of chloride discharged from household water softeners as well as other domestic, agricultural, commercial, and industrial sources. The analysis used multiple data sources, including salt sales records and wastewater monitoring data, and used statistical, spatial, and survey methods to estimate chloride loading from major sources statewide. Annual chloride mass contributions were estimated for the following sources: household water softener use; human excretions; household product use; chloride concentrations in drinking water; atmospheric deposition; road salt use; dust suppressant use; fertilizer application; industrial discharge; and livestock excretions. A mass balance for 96 wastewater treatment plants with effluent monitoring data showed that across these facilities, discharge from water softeners was the largest chloride source. A statewide chloride budget found that road salt was the largest source of chloride to the environment, but that WWTPs and fertilizer were also substantial sources, discharging 221,300 t and 209,900 t annually. Water softeners were estimated to contribute 65\% of the chloride discharged to all 613 municipal WWTPs statewide. Methods used in this analysis could be applied to other communities, watersheds, or states with similar conditions. The results of the analyses indicate that water softening is an important chloride source in areas with hard water and underscore the importance of identifying and characterizing chloride sources in less urban areas, where deicing salt may be a less important contributor and receiving water bodies are often lakes, reservoirs, and streams.},

Our study was designed to evaluate the effects of chloride contamination on urban stormwater pond food webs through changes in zooplankton community composition as well as density and biomass of primary producers and consumers. From May - July 2009, we employed a 2×2×2 full-factorial design to manipulate chloride concentration (low = 177 mg L(-1) Cl(-/)high = 1067 mg L(-1) Cl(-)), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles (presence/absence) and source of stormwater pond algae and zooplankton inoculum (low conductance/high conductance urban ponds) in 40, 600-L mesocosms. Road salt did serve as a constraint on zooplankton community structure, driving community divergence between the low and high chloride treatments. Phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll [a] µg L(-1)) in the mesocosms was significantly greater for the high conductance inoculum (P{\textbackslash}textless0.001) and in the high chloride treatment (P = 0.046), whereas periphyton biomass was significantly lower in the high chloride treatment (P = 0.049). Gray treefrog tadpole time to metamorphosis did not vary significantly between treatments. However, mass at metamorphosis was greater among tadpoles that experienced a faster than average time to metamorphosis and exposure to high chloride concentrations (P = 0.039). Our results indicate differential susceptibility to chloride salts among algal resources and zooplankton taxa, and further suggest that road salts can act as a significant environmental constraint on urban stormwater pond communities.},

	abstract = {Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are commonly measured to compute metabolism of aquatic ecosystems. However, concentrations of DIC and DO depend on many factors in addition to ecosystem metabolism, such as water temperature, gas exchange with the atmosphere, abiotic chemical reactions, and inputs in precipitation, groundwater, and surface water. We used 20-year time series from seven lakes to understand how DIC and DO concentrations are controlled as a function of time scale. Diel cycles of both solutes are controlled primarily by metabolism, exchange with the atmosphere, and temperature. At seasonal and annual scales, metabolism is important, but physical processes associated with spring and autumn mixing, as well as solute loading from the watershed, have comparably large effects. At decadal scales, effects of metabolism are negligible. Controls of the two solutes diverge, with variance in DIC explained largely by solute inputs and variance in DO explained largely by water temperature. Like other indicators in many ecosystems, variability of DIC and DO is strongly scale dependent and associated with different drivers depending on the time scale of the analysis. Key words: aquatic ecosystem metabolism; dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); dissolved oxygen (DO); drivers of DIC and DO; ecosystem drivers; lake concentrations of DIC and DO; long-term ecological research; temporal scale.},

Hypolimnetic enrichment of P was highest in Mendota and Devil’s and least in Fish and Sparkling. This enrichment was attributed mainly to internal loading in the noncalcareous lakes and regeneration of sedimenting epilimnetic P in the calcareous lakes. Differences in Fe scavenging efficiencies at fall turnover were related to hypolimnetic Fe:P molar ratios as well as Fe availability and its control by sulfate–sulfide chemistries. In the noncalcareous lakes with high hypolimnetic Fe enrichment (Fe:P {\textgreater} 2), 45\% of whole-lake total P was removed. P removal was low ({\textless}20\%) in the two calcareous lakes with minimal Fe enrichment (Fe:P {\textless} 2). These differences in hypolimnetic P enrichment and subsequent Fe scavenging at fall turnover help to explain the differences in the amount of P available for subsequent spring and summer primary production as well as the differences in trophic state of the four lakes.},

            One of the most important physical characteristics driving lifecycle events in lakes is stratification. Already subtle variations in the timing of stratification onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological effects, mainly by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and oxygen to organisms. Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global changes in stratification phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model ensemble and long-term observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, stratification will begin 22.0 ± 7.0 days earlier and end 11.3 ± 4.7 days later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3 ± 11.7 day prolongation in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is also likely.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Water temperatures and stratification are important drivers for ecological and water quality processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (1911–2014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.},

Manipulation of thermal habitat is a potential avenue of exploration for management of invasive species such as the cold-water rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), which has adverse effects on native fish communities in central North American inland lakes. In an effort to test the thermal limits and selectively eradicate rainbow smelt, we experimentally mixed Crystal Lake, Wisconsin, USA, during summer of 2012 and 2013 to warm the hypolimnion and eliminate cold-water habitat. This whole-ecosystem manipulation allowed for field testing of published thermal thresholds reported for rainbow smelt. The rainbow smelt population responded to the thermal manipulation by exhibiting unexpected shifts in behavior, intrapopulation divergence in body condition, and significant population declines. Small individuals of each adult age-class tended to survive the manipulation, and the population persisted despite high mortality rates. Our results indicate a high degree of size-based intrapopulation variation in thermal sensitivity for this species. Our findings also raise questions regarding applicability of lab- and model-derived thermal limits to field scenarios, highlighting a need for further field evaluations of species’ thermal limits.},

	volume = {25},
	doi = {https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1009-2021},
	abstract = {Abstract. The concentration of oxygen is fundamental to lake water quality and ecosystem functioning through its control over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics/nutrient loads, meteorology), as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal time scales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37-year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an evolutionary optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. By quantifying stability indices (Schmidt Stability, Birgean Work, stored internal heat), we identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the inter-annual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regression to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production.) Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50–60 days. The summer heat budget, as well as the timing of thermal stratification, were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. An earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) methylation is a microbially mediated process that converts inorganic Hg into bioaccumulative, neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg). The metabolic activity of methylating organisms is highly dependent on biogeochemical conditions, which subsequently influences MeHg production. However, our understanding of the ecophysiology of methylators in natural ecosystems is still limited. Here, we identified potential locations of MeHg production in the anoxic, sulfidic hypolimnion of a freshwater lake. At these sites, we used shotgun metagenomics to characterize microorganisms with the Hg-methylation gene hgcA. Putative methylators were dominated by hgcA sequences divergent from those in well-studied, confirmed methylators. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we identified organisms with hgcA (hgcA+) within the Bacteroidetes and the recently described Kiritimatiellaeota phyla. We identified hgcA+ genomes derived from sulfate-reducing bacteria, but these accounted for only 22\% of hgcA+ genome coverage. The most abundant hgcA+ genomes were from fermenters, accounting for over half of the hgcA gene coverage. Many of these organisms also mediate hydrolysis of polysaccharides, likely from cyanobacterial blooms. This work highlights the distribution of the Hg-methylation genes across microbial metabolic guilds and indicate that primary degradation of polysaccharides and fermentation may play an important but unrecognized role in MeHg production in the anoxic hypolimnion of freshwater lakes.},

Both biomass production and shoot morphology in Hydrilla varied significantly between solutions and among sediments. In contrast to N and P, which were readily mobilized from most sediments, K was mobilized from all sediments to only a minor extent by this species. Mobilization of K was proportional to interstitial water K concentration; yet on at least four of the six sediments examined, K supplied from sediments was insufficient to support the maximal growth of Hydrilla. The open water rather than the sediment appears to be the primary source of K supply to this species and perhaps to most other submersed freshwater macrophytes. Where K was supplied in solution, sediment-related differences in the growth of Hydrilla negatively correlated with sediment organic matter content over the range 0.2–56.2\% dry sediment mass. It is tentatively suggested that the organic composition of sediments may influence the species composition of aquatic macrophyte communities.},

The front accelerated heat transport downward through the main thermocline, resulting in hypolimnetic warming; the vertical eddy conductivity Kz increased monotonically with depth from a minimum 0.8 m2 day-I at 16 m to 1.9 m2 day-I at 21 m. The front also affected significant lateral and vertical redistribution of three passive solute 'tracers': phosphate (P), silicic acid (Si) and soluble reduced manganese (Mn2+). Lateral concentration gradients along isopycnals predating the storm were erased. For Mn, especially, the vertical redistribution within the hypolimnion agreed with modeled changes based on vertical gradients and the Kz profile. Mn and P behaved quasi-conservatively within the anoxic hypolimnion (no net sources or sinks), but additional supplies of Si appeared in the hypolimnion (8.0 ± 1.5 mg m -3 day-I ). This rate over 4 days agreed with the mean rate of hypolimnetic Si accumulation over the 80 day interval preceding 7 September 1977 (8.7 mg m-3 day -1 ). These results corroborate other environmental evidence that Mn and P both enter Lake Mendota's hypolimnion mainly during the first half of the summer, prior to the onset of bulk hypolimnetic anoxia, whereas Si is released by hypolimnetic sediments continuing into the late summer.},

Downriver, most soluble elements increase (Ba, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Rb, S, and Sr) while statistically significant decreases in insoluble elements (Al, Ce, Dy, Er, Fe, Gd, La, Mn, Nd, Pr, and Y) also occur. Lithium, Si, and Zr did not show a consistent increasing or decreasing trend. Concentrations of most elements measured on June 5, 2008 were greater than 7 weeks later; however, greater discharge and lower pH enhanced Al concentrations occurred during the later sampling date. Elemental ratios track changes in lithology, anthropogenic influence, and pH. The Raquette River shows the least variation in elemental concentrations because of storage in numerous hydropower reservoirs and has non-detectable concentrations of some redox sensitive elements such as Co, Ni, and V. Oswegatchie tributaries display similar geochemical trends dependent upon their location and local bedrock and show geochemical trends along the trunks of major rivers that are also evident in smaller drainage basins. Comparison with analytical results from the Western Adirondack Stream Survey also indicates acidification is prevalent in the Adirondack Highlands, particularly in the Oswegatchie headwaters during periods of high flow, but acidity is rapidly buffered downriver due to interaction with marble in the Adirondack Lowlands.},

These two algal forms were selected so as to also check if shape of algal forms plays a role in their ability to absorb potassium. The cultures were kept at 5000 lux for a period of 30 days to check their stability for potassium absorption capacity. The algal biomass was harvested, dried and converted to ash for estimation of potassium using method described by Jacobs and Hoffman (J Biol Chem 93: 685–691, 1931). C. oocystiformis has highest ash content of 30.5 \% when exposed to 400 ppm of K+ and at this concentration it could take up to 74.8 \% of total potassium it was exposed to C. braunii has ash content of 37.5 \% when exposed to 1000 ppm of K+, but has potassium content of 12.35 \% when exposed to 1800 ppm of K+.

While land use and land cover (LULC) models have been developed to model potential future LULC change, few eﬀorts have focused on recreating historical landscapes. Researchers at the US Geological Survey have used a wide range of historical data sources and a spatially explicit modeling framework to model spatially explicit historical LULC change in the conterminous United States from 1992 back to 1938. Annual LULC maps were produced at 250-m resolution, with 14 LULC classes. Assessment of model results showed good agreement with trends and spatial patterns in historical data sources such as the Census of Agriculture and historical housing density data, although comparison with historical data is complicated by deﬁnitional and methodological diﬀerences. The completion of this dataset allows researchers to assess historical LULC impacts on a range of ecological processes.},

	abstract = {Influxes of saline water from roads treated with deicers can alter the density structure of urban lakes. This can diminish or halt turnover events, such that lakes may transition from dimixis to monomixis or meromixis. In nutrient-rich lakes, this lack of turnover can produce persistent hypolimnetic anoxia. We hypothesized that diminished turnover in urban lakes impacted by road salt inputs would lead to increased accumulation of methane in the hypolimnia, with the potential for greater release of methane to the atmosphere via ebullition and from larger storage fluxes of methane when turnover events do occur. The lake water columns of two urban lakes (Woods Lake and Asylum Lake), previously suggested to have transitioned to meromixis and monomixis because of road salt deicer inputs, were sampled monthly from March 2016 to June 2017. A nearby rural lake (North Lake) less likely to be impacted by road salt and maintaining seasonal mixing, was also sampled for comparison. Lake column water was analyzed for conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ferrous iron, manganese, sulfide, calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride and methane concentrations as a function of depth. All three lakes are eutrophic with at least seasonally anoxic hypolimnia. Our data are consistent with prior studies suggesting that Woods Lake has transitioned to meromixis and Asylum Lake to monomixis due to an influx of dense saline water from roads treated with deicers. In contrast, rural North Lake, which had much lower chloride, sodium and conductivity levels, was dimictic. The diminished or absent turnover in the two urban lakes during fall and spring resulted in persistently anoxic, redox-stratified hypolimnia, with much larger accumulations of methane compared to the rural lake. This study demonstrates that road salt deicers impact lake mixing and biogeochemistry, especially methane concentrations, with the potential for significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions from urban lakes.},

	abstract = {Salt pollution and human-accelerated weathering are shifting the chemical composition of major ions in fresh water and increasing salinization and alkalinization across North America. We propose a concept, the freshwater salinization syndrome, which links salinization and alkalinization processes. This syndrome manifests as concurrent trends in specific conductance, pH, alkalinity, and base cations. Although individual trends can vary in strength, changes in salinization and alkalinization have affected 37\% and 90\%, respectively, of the drainage area of the contiguous United States over the past century. Across 232 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring sites, 66\% of stream and river sites showed a statistical increase in pH, which often began decades before acid rain regulations. The syndrome is most prominent in the densely populated eastern and midwestern United States, where salinity and alkalinity have increased most rapidly. The syndrome is caused by salt pollution (e.g., road deicers, irrigation runoff, sewage, potash), accelerated weathering and soil cation exchange, mining and resource extraction, and the presence of easily weathered minerals used in agriculture (lime) and urbanization (concrete). Increasing salts with strong bases and carbonates elevate acid neutralizing capacity and pH, and increasing sodium from salt pollution eventually displaces base cations on soil exchange sites, which further increases pH and alkalinization. Symptoms of the syndrome can include: infrastructure corrosion, contaminant mobilization, and variations in coastal ocean acidification caused by increasingly alkaline river inputs. Unless regulated and managed, the freshwater salinization syndrome can have significant impacts on ecosystem services such as safe drinking water, contaminant retention, and biodiversity.},

The moraine underlies an extensive urban and industrial landscape, which draws its water supply from {\textgreater}20 wellfields, several of which are approaching or have exceeded the drinking water limit for chloride. The study investigates the mechanisms of road salt infiltration, storage, and transport in the subsurface and assesses the effectiveness of mitigation measures designed to reduce the impact. The three-dimensional transport model accounts for increases in salt loading, as well as growth of the urbanized area and road network over the past 50 years. The simulations, which focus on one impacted wellfield, show chloride plumes originating mainly at arterial roads and migrating through aquitard windows into the water supply aquifers. The results suggest that the aquifer system contains a large and heterogeneously distributed mass of chloride and that concentrations in the aquifer can be substantially higher than the concentrations in the well water. Future impact scenarios indicate that although the system responds rapidly to reductions in salt loading, the residual chloride mass may take decades to flush out, even if road salting were discontinued. The implications with respect to urban wellfields in typical snow-belt areas are discussed.},

Road salt has resulted in the salinization of surface waters across temperate North America. Increasingly, road salt is recognized as a significant regional pollutant in the Adirondack Park. Here we analyze biweekly limnological data from Mirror Lake (Lake Placid, NY) to understand the role of road salt runoff in an apparent lack of spring mixing in 2017. Water column profile data show notable spatial and temporal variability in chloride concentrations within the lake. Concentrations are highest at the lake bottom during the winter, with increases associated with the onset of road salt application to the watershed. High chloride concentrations in the hypolimnion persisted through the summer of 2017 due to a lack of complete spring mixing as the result of road salt induced density differences within the water column. Water density calculations and Schmidt stability point to an increase in water column stability due to the accumulation of salt at the lake bottom. The incomplete spring mixing resulted in greater spatial and temporal extent of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion, reducing habitat availability for lake trout. Restoration of lake mixing would occur rapidly upon significant reduction of road salt application to the watershed and improvements in stormwater management.},

This review collates information on the effects of Na+ on the metabolism of cyanobacteria with emphasis on the N2,fixing filamentous species. Na+ is required for nitrogenase activity inAnabaena torulosa, Anabaena L-31 andPlectonema boryanum. The features of this requirement have been mainly studied inAnabaena torulosa. The need for Na+ is specific and cannot be replaced by K+, Li+, Ca 2 + or Mg2+. Processes crucial for expression of nitrogenase such as molybdenum uptake, protection of the enzyme from oxygen inactivation and conformational activation of the enzyme are not affected by Na+. Mo-Fe protein and Fe protein, the two components of nitrogenase are synthesized in the absence of Na+ but the enzyme complex is catalytically inactive. Photoevolution of O2 and CO2 fixation, which are severely inhibited in the absence of Na+, are quickly restored by glutamine or glutamate indicating that Na+ deprivation affects photosynthesis indirectly due to deficiency in the products of N2 fixation. Na+ deprivation decreases phosphate uptake, nucleoside phosphate pool and nitrogenase activity. These effects are reversed by the addition of Na+ suggesting that a limitation of available ATP caused by reduced phosphate uptake results in loss of nitrogenase activity during Na+ starvation.},

We transformed a mutant impaired in CO2 uptake and in cmpA–D encoding a HCO3−transporter with a transposon inactivation library, and we recovered mutants unable to take up HCO3− and grow in low CO2 at pH 9.0. They are all tagged within slr1512 (designated sbtA). We show that SbtA-mediated transport is induced by low CO2, requires Na+, and plays the major role in HCO3− uptake in Synechocystis. Inactivation of slr1509 (homologous to ntpJ encoding a Na+/K+-translocating protein) abolished the ability of cells to grow at [Na+] higher than 100 mm and severely depressed the activity of the SbtA-mediated HCO3− transport. We propose that the SbtA-mediated HCO3− transport is driven by ΔμNa+ across the plasma membrane, which is disrupted by inactivating ntpJ. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that two types of sbtA exist in various cyanobacterial strains, all of which possess ntpJ. The sbtA gene is the first one identified as essential to Na+-dependent HCO3− transport in photosynthetic organisms and may play a crucial role in carbon acquisition when CO2 supply is limited, or in Prochlorococcus strains that do not possess CO2uptake systems or Cmp-dependent HCO3− transport.},

Human population growth and land-use change are important drivers of ecosystem change in both regions. Biotic changes such as habitat loss, species invasions, and poorer fishing were prevalent in the rural region, and lake hydrology and biogeochemistry responded to climate trends and landscape position. Similar biotic changes occurred in the urbanizing agricultural region, where human-caused changes in hydrology and biogeochemistry had conspicuous effects. Feedbacks among ecosystem dynamics, human uses, economics, social dynamics, and policy and practice are fundamental to understanding change in these lake districts. Sustained support for interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to build understanding of regional change.},

In this context, we analyzed the agricultural, urbanizing Yahara watershed (size: 1345 km², population: 372,000) to assess its responses to multiple changing drivers. We measured recent trends in land use/cover and water quality of the watershed, spatial patterns of 10 ecosystem services, and spatial patterns and nestedness of governance. We developed scenarios for the future of the Yahara watershed by integrating trends and events from the global scenarios literature, perspectives of stakeholders, and models of biophysical drivers and ecosystem services. Four qualitative scenarios were created to explore plausible trajectories to the year 2070 in the watershed’s social-ecological system under different regimes: no action on environmental trends, accelerated technological development, strong intervention by government, and shifting values toward sustainability. Quantitative time-series for 2010–2070 were developed for weather and land use/cover during each scenario as inputs to model changes in ecosystem services. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how changes in the social-ecological system of the Yahara watershed, including management of land and water resources, can build or impair resilience to shifting drivers, including climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Water temperatures and stratification are important drivers for ecological and water quality processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (1911–2014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.},

These records extend back prior to any reliable air temperature data in the midwestern region of the U.S. and demonstrate significant warming of approximately 1.5 {\textasciitilde} in fall and early winter temperatures and 2.5 {\textasciitilde} in winter and spring temperatures during the past 135 years. These changes are not completely monotonic, but rather appear as two shorter periods of chmatic change in the longer record. The first change was between 1875 and 1890, when fall, winter, and spring air temperatures increased by approximately 1.5 *C. The second change, earlier ice breakup dates since 1979, was caused by a significant increase in winter and early spring air temperatures of approximately 1.3 {\textasciitilde} This change may be indicative of shifts in regional climatic patterns associated with global warming, possibly associated with the 'Greenhouse Effect: With the relationships between air temperature and freeze and break up dates, we can project how the ice cover of Lake Mendota should respond to future climatic changes. If warming occurs, the ice cover for Lake Mendota should decrease approximately 11 days per 1 {\textasciitilde} increase. With a warming of 4 to 5 {\textasciitilde} years with no ice cover should occur in approximately 1 out of 15 to 30 years.},

The system infrastructure comprises a web portal to retrieve and display observations that are used to drive models under a high performance computing server. Water level and flow discharge information are obtained from a suite of models that be directly simulate the RCL system. A new data assimilation technique based upon flow routing algorithm and nested-mesh domain reduction is developed to update the Manning’s roughness. It is demonstrated that the INFOS can reliably and effectively model real-time reverse flows due to sustained wind forcings or tranisent seiches, and flow choking due to channel constriction. Applications of the developed system are illustrated. Specifically water level planning scenarios provide a quantitative measure for lake management to reduce floods under extreme rainfall events. Alternative management philosophies to minimize exceeding the water level orders are evaluated. Overall, the Integrated Nowcast and Forecast Operation System (INFOS) provides reliable and timely water information for the RCL for sharing information to the community, planning for water use and delivery, and management of the Yahara RCL.},

	abstract = {Human impacts on freshwater ecosystems are pervasive, but the short and discontinuous nature of most datasets limits our ability to understand the controls on water quality and effectively manage freshwater resources. We examine change in Lake Mendota (Madison, Wisconsin) over the last two centuries by pairing analyses of a sedimentary archive with the site’s {\textgreater} 100 yr limnological record. We show that eutrophication of the lake, evident as an abrupt shift in sediment composition, began in the late 19th century following the intensiﬁcation of urban and agricultural land use in the watershed. Efforts to address deterioration of lake water quality, including the removal of point-source pollutants and biomanipulation, have had a measurable inﬂuence on sediment composition and water clarity. Since the early 1980s, quasi-seasonal cycles of phytoplankton blooms have induced calcite precipitation, leaving distinct laminations in the sedimentary record. These “whiting events” evidently did not accumulate in lake sediments until the late 20th century, indicating that efforts to remediate water quality have shifted the lake to a new ecosystem state. Calcite whitings can improve water quality in eutrophic lakes by coprecipitation with phosphate, increasing phosphorus (P) burial in lake sediments. Using long-term limnological records, we report negative correlations between calcite saturation indices and P in lake surface waters and show that calcite whitings could partially explain recent P decline in Lake Mendota surface waters. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized potential control on water quality in this eutrophic lake and demonstrates the beneﬁt of coupling long-term limnological data with sedimentary records.},

	abstract = {The forms and distribution of sulfur in the black bottom muds of Lake Mendota have been determined and the data combined with available background information to gain understanding of sulfur metabolism in a freshwater sulfuretum and of the generic relationships among various forms of sulfur. The suite of sulfur compounds in the lake sediments is made up of sulfide dissolved in the interstitial water, acid-volatile sulfide, elemental sulfur, organic sulfur, and sulfates. The dominant form of sulfur in the sludge is a black, amorphous, acid-soluble substance believed to be hydrotroilite. No pyrite or marcasite was isolated from these bottom muds. Nearly 45\% of the sulfur precipitated as sulfide is apparently derived from mineralization of organic matter with the remaining fraction coming from bacterial reduction of sulfates. The sulfur analyses coupled with other evidence suggest that prior to the change in sedimentation in Lake Mendota associated with human activity the lake had developed an oxygen deficiency intense enough to cause the reduction of sulfates to sulfides but was able to maintain its basin free of black muds by processes of self-purification.},

Theoretical mechanisms generating frequent extremes apply to both environmental and biological processes, yet past studies of ecological extremes have focused primarily on the abiotic environment. The rarity or commonness of extremes in biological time series is unknown. We evaluated the statistical tendency to produce extreme events in 595 biological, chemical, physical, and meteorological time series taken from 11 lakes. We found that extreme events were much more likely to occur for biological variables than for other categories. Additional analysis revealed that the tendency to produce extremes was driven primarily by within-year dynamics, suggesting that processes occurring at short time scales underlie the high frequency of extremes in biological variables. These results should lead us to expect surprises in long-term observations of biological populations.},

	abstract = {Aim To review and synthesize multiple lines of evidence that describe the spatial patterns of land use associated with prehistoric and early historical Native American societies in eastern North America in order to better characterize the type, spatial extent and temporal persistence of past land use. Location Temperate forests of eastern North America, and the Eastern Woodlands cultural region. Methods Ethnohistorical accounts, archaeological data, historical land surveys and palaeoecological records describing indigenous forms of silviculture and agriculture were evaluated across scales ranging from local (100 km) to regional (102 km) to produce a synthetic description of land-use characteristics. Results Indigenous land-use practices created patches of distinct ecological conditions within a heterogeneous mosaic of ecosystem types. At all scales, patch location was dynamic, and patches underwent recurrent periods of expansion, contraction and abandonment. Land-use patches varied in their extent and persistence, and are broadly categorized as silvicultural (management of undomesticated woodland taxa) or agricultural (cultivation of domesticated taxa). Silvicultural patches persisted for centuries and extended kilometres to tens of kilometres around settlements and travel corridors. The dynamics of agricultural patches varied among groups, with persistence ranging from decades to centuries and extent ranging from less than a kilometre to tens of kilometres around settlements. Beyond patch boundaries, human impacts on ecosystems become indistinguishable from other drivers of environmental heterogeneity. These characteristics of patches are evident across scales and multiple lines of evidence. Main conclusions Our findings challenge the view that prehistoric human impacts on vegetation were widespread and ubiquitous, and build on previous work showing these impacts to be more localized and heterogeneous by providing quantitative descriptions of land-use patch characteristics. Collaborative efforts that combine multiple data sources are needed to refine these descriptions and generate more precise measures of land-use pattern to further investigate the history of human impacts on the Earth system.},

Frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are increasing in agricultural regions of the Upper Midwestern U.S., and these increases are projected to continue as climate warms. We quantiﬁed the linkage between extreme daily precipitation and extreme daily discharge, phosphorus (P) load, and P concentration for Pheasant Branch and the Yahara River, two tributaries of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, U.S.A. using the generalized Pareto distribution. Although precipitation extremes have increased since 1940, over the shorter period of stream monitoring (1994–2015 for Pheasant Branch and 1991–2015 for Yahara) there is no signiﬁcant trend in extreme precipitation. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of extreme precipitation events (for example seven of the 11 largest 24-h events since 1901) occurred during the period of stream monitoring. Daily precipitation extremes were associated with extremes in daily discharge and P load. P load return levels increased steeply and almost linearly with precipitation on log-log axes. The trend toward more frequent and intense precipitation extremes will increase P loading and intensify the eutrophication of the lake, unless the excessive P enrichment of the watershed is reversed.},

              Harmful blooms of the filamentous cyanobacteria
              Planktothrix rubescens
              have become common in many lakes as they have recovered from eutrophication over the last decades. These cyanobacteria, capable of regulating their vertical position, often flourish at the thermocline to form a deep chlorophyll maximum. In Lake Zurich (Switzerland), they accumulate during stratified season (May–October) as a persistent metalimnetic thin layer ({\textasciitilde}2 m wide). This study investigated the role of turbulent mixing in springtime layer formation, its persistence over the summer, and its breakdown in autumn. We characterised seasonal variation of turbulence in Lake Zurich with four surveys conducted in April, July and October of 2018 and September of 2019. Surveys included microstructure profiles and high-resolution mooring measurements. In July and October, the thin layer occurred within a strong thermocline (

               cm). Consistently, vertical diffusivity was close to molecular values, indicating negligible turbulent fluxes. This reduced metalimnetic mixing explains the persistence of the thin layer, which disappears with the deepening of the surface mixed layer in autumn. Bi-weekly temperature profiles in 2018 and a nighttime microstructure sampling in September 2019 showed that nighttime convection serves as the main mechanism driving the breakdown of the cyanobacterial layer in autumn. These results highlight the importance of light winds and convective mixing in the seasonal cycling of

Warmer temperatures and lower wind speeds increased the size and duration of hypoxic and anoxic regions by lengthening the stratified period. Decreased wind speed increased hypolimnion thickness while decreasing its temperature and DO consumption rate. Decreased TP loading improved DO conditions with a reduction of 75\% effectively abolishing hypoxia. Anoxia was more sensitive to air temperature, wind and nutrient changes than was hypoxia. New metrics that capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of low DO conditions were more sensitive than the commonly-cited maximum areas of hypoxia or anoxia. Over most of the relevant range of forcing factors, the simple and first order effect of a 1 °C temperature change was equivalent to a 10-14\% change in TP loads, while a 1\% change in wind speed was equivalent to a 2-3\% change in TP loads. Reduced ice cover in warmer climates will likely increase air temperature effects even further.},

	abstract = {A common perception in limnology is that shallow lakes are homogeneously mixed owing to their small water volume. However, this perception is largely gained by downscaling knowledge from large lakes to their smaller counterparts. Here we show that shallow vegetated lakes (less than 0.6 m), in fact, undergo recurring daytime stratification and nocturnal mixing accompanied by extreme chemical variations during summer. Dense submerged vegetation effectively attenuates light and turbulence generating separation between warm surface waters and much colder bottom waters. Photosynthesis in surface waters produces oxygen accumulation and CO
              2
              depletion, whereas respiration in dark bottom waters causes anoxia and CO
              2
              accumulation. High daytime pH in surface waters promotes precipitation of CaCO
              3
              which is re-dissolved in bottom waters. Nocturnal convective mixing re-introduces oxygen into bottom waters for aerobic respiration and regenerated inorganic carbon into surface waters, which supports intense photosynthesis. Our results reconfigure the basic understanding of local environmental gradients in shallow lakes, one of the most abundant freshwater habitats globally.},

The compounds were added to 1 l of water sample from Monjolinho Reservoir. Dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic carbon were monitored during 20 days and the results were fitted to first order kinetics model. During the 20 days of experiments, the oxygen consumption varied from 4.5 mg.l-1 (tannic acid) to 71.5 mg.l-1 (glucose). The highest deoxygenation rate (kD) was observed for mineralization of tannic acid (0.321 day-1) followed by glycine, starch, lysine, sucrose and glucose (0.1004, 0.0504, 0.0486, 0.0251 and 0.0158 day-1, respectively). From theoretical calculations and oxygen and carbon concentrations we obtained the stoichiometry of the mineralization processes. Stoichiometric values varied from 0.17 (tannic acid) to 2.55 (sucrose).

Os compostos foram adicionados a 1 l de amostra de água do Reservatório do Monjolinho (22º 00 ' S; 47º 54 ' W). As concentrações de oxigênio e de carbono orgânico dissolvidos foram determinadas durante 20 dias. Os resultados foram ajustados a modelos cinéticos de primeira ordem, observou-se que durante os 20 dias de experimento o consumo de oxigênio variou de 4,5 mg.l-1 (ácido tânico) a 71,5 mg.l-1 (glicose). Os coeficientes de desoxigenação (kD) mais elevados foram observados para o ácido tânico (0,321 dia-1) seguido pela glicina, amido, lisina, sacarose e glicose (0,1004, 0,0504, 0,0486, 0,0251 e 0,0158 dia-1, respectivamente). A partir de cálculos teóricos e das concentrações de oxigênio e de carbono foram obtidas as estequiometrias dos processos de mineralização. Os valores estequiométricos variaram de 0,17 (ácido tânico) a 2,55 (sacarose).},

	abstract = {Recent literature has suggested that for many lakes and rivers, the respiratory breakdown of organic matter (R) exceeds production of organic matter by photosynthesis (gross primary production [GPP]) within the water body. This metabolic balance (GPP {\textgreater} R; “heterotrophy”) implies that allochthonous organic matter supports a portion of the aquatic ecosystem's respiration. Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of lake types studied, especially with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are two reasons for differing conclusions. We deployed O2 and CO2 sondes to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 lakes. From these data, we calculated GPP, R, and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP − R). Over the broad range in TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O2 changed on a near 1 : 1 molar ratio. Metabolism estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set had negative NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were nearly equal, but, at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had negative NEP. Strong correlations between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon influences lake metabolism.},

This study used high-frequency data from 15 lakes provided by the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) to study how model choice of k influenced estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere. We tested 6 models of k on lakes chosen to span broad gradients in surface area and trophic states; a metabolism model was then fit to all 6 outputs of k data. We found that hourly values for k were substantially different between models and, at an annual scale, resulted in significantly different estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere.},

To do so, this study integrated 6 yr of eddy-covariance flux tower observations of lake-atmosphere fluxes with high-frequency observations of in-lake temperature, dissolved oxygen, and partial pressure of CO2, for a eutrophic lake in Wisconsin, U.S.A. While growing season fluxes are variable and switch between source and sink, annual net carbon fluxes show the lake acts as an annual sink of carbon, with the magnitude depending on climate, along with the timing and strength of fall turnover, with half of the total annual carbon uptake happening in October and November.},

	abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) for up to a full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0.1 to 5.0 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5\% to 85\% of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Background respiration ranged from 0.017 to 2.1 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and was positively related to indicators of recalcitrant allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter loads, but was not clearly related to an indicator of the quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs.},

Averaged over the deployment, aerial metabolism estimates among sensor locations varied 1–2 orders of magnitude and were largely unrelated to physical habitat within the lake. For all sites and days, 76–90\% of the explainable variance in GPP and R was attributable to location in the lake rather than day of the deployment. NEP, on the other hand, was less affected by location, with 79–93\% of the explained variance attributable to the day of the deployment. Single-location estimates can yield errors of more than an order of magnitude in estimates of daily GPP and R and can mischaracterize the trophic status of the lake. Using a rarefaction approach, we found that using four randomly placed sensors increased the precision of the resulting daily metabolism estimates fourfold over single-location measures in both lakes.},

The models used to estimate metabolism often subsume biological processes into one parameter each for GPP and R. However, high-frequency DO observations made over days show diverse patterns at multiple time scales, suggesting a complex suite of processes controls DO dynamics. Can we improve metabolism estimates and predictive ability for DO at diel scales by adding complexity to the models? In this study, we use data from two north temperate lakes to test a variety of metabolism models representing a suite of non-linear metabolic processes. To test whether alternative models can be discriminated, we simulated DO with assumed parameter values and auto-regressive noise, and fit the models to the simulated DO. The most complex model could be discriminated from simpler models and provided the most accurate and precise predictions. However, when models were fit to observed DO data from the sensor network, the simplest model predicted DO as well as the most complex one. The added complexity did not improve model performance. An analysis of the model residuals indicates that physics may explain some of the DO pattern not predicted, especially high-frequency oscillations and anomalies that appear to coincide with weather patterns. Under reasonably stable weather conditions and at scales of a few days, simple metabolism models explain the bulk of diel DO variability.},

	abstract = {We quantify the allochthonous organic carbon (OC) budgets for seven north temperate lakes, using diverse information about their land cover, hydrology, and limnological characteristics. We develop a simple equilibrium model within a Bayesian framework that exploits the differences among the lakes to estimate three key rates: aerial loading (AOC) and wetland loading (WOC) from adjacent ecosystems and whole-lake mineralization of OC (RDOC). Combined with observational data, these rates allow for estimates of the total OC loads, mineralization, and sedimentation within lakes and export to downstream ecosystems. AOC was 1.15 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, WOC ranged from 0.72 to 3.00 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, and RDOC, normalized to 20°C, ranged from 0.00083 to 0.0015 d−1. Total loads ranged from about 5 to 55 g C m−2 yr−1. Ecosystems immediately adjacent to lakes accounted for one-half or more of total OC loads for some lakes. Whether a lake processed and stored more allochthonous OC than it exported depended primarily on hydrologic residence time. Our equilibrium model provides a parsimonious approach to quantifying allochthonous OC budgets in lakes with relatively minimal baseline data.},

	abstract = {The Livingstone and Imboden (1996) model for the oxygen depletion rate in lake hypolimnia was evaluated with field results in 32 lakes. The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

	abstract = {The development of complete regional carbon (C) budgets for different biomes is an integral step in the effort to predict global response and potential feedbacks to a changing climate regime. Wetland and lake contributions to regional C cycling remain relatively uncertain despite recent research highlighting their importance. Using a combination of field surveys and tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, modeling, and published literature, we constructed a complete C budget for the Northern Highlands Lake District in northern Wisconsin/Michigan, a ∼6400 km2 region rich in lakes and wetlands. This is one of the first regional C budgets to incorporate aquatic and terrestrial C cycling under the same framework. We divided the landscape into three major compartments (forests, wetlands, and surface waters) and quantified all major C fluxes into and out of those compartments, with a particular focus on atmospheric exchange but also including sedimentation in lakes and hydrologic fluxes. Landscape C storage was dominated by peat-containing wetlands and lake sediments, which make up only 20\% and 13\% of the landscape area, respectively, but contain {\textgreater}80\% of the total fixed C pool (ca. 400 Tg). We estimated a current regional C accumulation of 1.1±0.1 Tg yr−1, and the largest regional flux was forest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into aggrading forests for a total of 1.0±0.1 Tg yr−1. Mean wetland NEE (0.12±0.06 Tg yr−1 into wetlands), lake CO2 emissions and riverine efflux (each ca. 0.03±0.01 Tg yr−1) were smaller but of consequence to the overall budget. Hydrologic transport from uplands/wetlands to surface waters within the region was an important vector of terrestrial C. Regional C fluxes and pools would be misrepresented without inclusion of surface waters and wetlands, and C budgets in heterogeneous landscapes open opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important fluxes to changes in climate and land use/land cover.},

We fit Bayesian hierarchical models to thousands of observations from over two decades to quantify four components of variation – spatial (local and regional) and temporal (local and coherent); and to model their drivers. We found strong support for three propositions: (1) spatial variation at local and regional scales are large and roughly equal, (2) annual temporal variation is mostly local rather than coherent, and, (3) spatial variation exceeds temporal variation. Our findings imply that predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes at macroscales requires consideration of the dominant spatial signals at both local and regional scales that may overwhelm temporal signals.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 °C during the test period (DL: 1.78 °C, PB: 2.03 °C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.},

Parallel increases in concentration across the seven lakes during drought were attributable to evapoconcentration. However, we observed divergent trends for mass, which better reflects altered solute flux by accounting for changes in lake volume. Ca+Mg mass increased in three groundwater-dominated lakes as precipitation inputs were low and groundwater discharging from longer flowpaths became proportionately more important. In contrast, decreases in Ca+Mg mass for two precipitation-dominated lakes reflected diminished inputs of solute-rich groundwater. Landscape position, defined by the spatial position of a lake within a hydrologic flow system, accounted for the divergence in chemical responses to drought.},

All lakes underwent an abrupt increase in VWHO and mean hypolimnetic DO after 2010. In four of the six study lakes, the highest hypolimnetic DO concentrations were observed in years where chlorophyll a concentrations were low, whereas at ﬁve of the six study lakes the highest hypolimnetic volumes were observed when dissolved organic carbon concentrations were relatively high. Warmer spring or winter air temperatures were associated with higher hypolimnetic DO concentrations at two sites, and longer ice-free periods were associated with smaller hypolimnetic volumes at two sites. These results suggest that the recent VWHO increases in the studied south-central Ontario lakes may be a function of multiple drivers that include changes in primary production, lake water transparency, and regional climatic factors.},

New production values obtained with these analyses of oxygen curves from various sources, as well as a few previously existing estimates of primary production, indicate a generally higher rate of production in flowing waters than in other types of aquatic environments. The ratio of total primary production to total community respiration is used to classify communities quantitatively according to their predominantly heterotrophic or autotrophic characteristics. Longitudinal succession within a stream tends to modify the ratio towards unity from higher values for autotrophic and from lower values for heterotrophic communities. The behavior of this ratio is described for the annual cycle in a stream, for the sequence of pollution recovery, and for diverse types of communities.},

This understanding is improved by combining ecological models with empirical observations from a variety of sources. Bayesian hierarchical models explicitly couple process-based models and data, yielding probabilistic quantification of model parameters, system characteristics, and associated uncertainties.

	abstract = {Measurements of the production and consumption of organic material have been a focus of aquatic science for more than 80 years. Over the last century, a variety of approaches have been developed and employed for measuring rates of gross primary production (Pg), respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (Pn = Pg − R) within aquatic ecosystems. Here, we reconsider the range of approaches and applications for ecosystem metabolism measurements, and suggest ways by which such studies can continue to contribute to aquatic ecology. This paper reviews past and contemporary studies of aquatic ecosystem-level metabolism to identify their role in understanding and managing aquatic systems. We identify four broad research objectives that have motivated ecosystem metabolism studies: (1) quantifying magnitude and variability of metabolic rates for cross-system comparison, (2) estimating organic matter transfer between adjacent systems or subsystems, (3) measuring ecosystem-scale responses to perturbation, both natural and anthropogenic, and (4) quantifying and calibrating models of biogeochemical processes and trophic networks. The magnitudes of whole-system gross primary production, respiration and net ecosystem production rates vary among aquatic environments and are partly constrained by the chosen methodology. We argue that measurements of ecosystem metabolism should be a vital component of routine monitoring at larger scales in the aquatic environment using existing flexible, precise, and durable sensor technologies. Current and future aquatic ecosystem studies will benefit from application of new methods for metabolism measurements, which facilitate integration of process measurements and calibration of models for addressing fundamental questions involving ecosystem-scale processes.},

Warmer temperatures and lower wind speeds increased the size and duration of hypoxic and anoxic regions by lengthening the stratified period. Decreased wind speed increased hypolimnion thickness while decreasing its temperature and DO consumption rate. Decreased TP loading improved DO conditions with a reduction of 75\% effectively abolishing hypoxia. Anoxia was more sensitive to air temperature, wind and nutrient changes than was hypoxia. New metrics that capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of low DO conditions were more sensitive than the commonly-cited maximum areas of hypoxia or anoxia. Over most of the relevant range of forcing factors, the simple and first order effect of a 1 °C temperature change was equivalent to a 10-14\% change in TP loads, while a 1\% change in wind speed was equivalent to a 2-3\% change in TP loads. Reduced ice cover in warmer climates will likely increase air temperature effects even further.},

	abstract = {Many lakes exhibit seasonal stratification, during which they develop strong thermal and chemical gradients. An expansion of depth-integrated monitoring programs has provided insight into the importance of organic carbon processing that occurs below the upper mixed layer. However, the chemical and physical drivers of metabolism and metabolic coupling remain unresolved, especially in the metalimnion. In this depth zone, sharp gradients in key resources such as light and temperature co-occur with dynamic physical conditions that influence metabolic processes directly and simultaneously hamper the accurate tracing of biological activity. We evaluated the drivers of metalimnetic metabolism and its associated uncertainty across 10 stratified lakes in Europe and North America. We hypothesized that the metalimnion would contribute highly to whole-lake functioning in clear oligotrophic lakes, and that metabolic rates would be highly variable in unstable polymictic lakes. Depth-integrated rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were modelled from diel dissolved oxygen curves using a Bayesian approach. Metabolic estimates were more uncertain below the epilimnion, but uncertainty was not consistently related to lake morphology or mixing regime. Metalimnetic rates exhibited high day-to-day variability in all trophic states, with the metalimnetic contribution to daily whole-lake GPP and ER ranging from 0\% to 87\% and {\textless} 1\% to 92\%, respectively. Nonetheless, the metalimnion of low-nutrient lakes contributed strongly to whole-lake metabolism on average, driven by a collinear combination of highlight, low surface-water phosphorous concentration and high metalimnetic volume. Consequently, a single-sensor approach does not necessarily reflect whole-ecosystem carbon dynamics in stratified lakes.},

	abstract = {H. T. Odum's influential Limnology and Oceanography 1956 publication compared gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) among aquatic ecosystems. Few syntheses of aquatic ecosystem metabolism have been completed since. We used Odum's conceptual framework to compare GPP and ER from open-water diel oxygen curves in lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and streams (n = 350). We also documented environmental drivers of metabolism among ecosystems. GPP and ER were strongly related in lakes and estuaries, but weakly related in streams and wetlands. GPP and ER were highest in estuaries, and GPP : ER was lowest in streams. Differences in the magnitude and variability of metabolism among ecosystems were attributable to landscape and water-column factors. Watershed size and phosphorus (P) concentrations were positively related to GPP and ER across all ecosystems. Considered independently, lake and estuary GPP were driven by P concentrations. In contrast, land-use and canopy cover drove stream metabolism, not nutrient concentrations. Results confirmed the classic paradigm that estuaries are the most productive aquatic ecosystem; however, our synthesis showed that relative to streams and estuaries, there was higher variation in lake GPP and ER than previously documented. Results will be valuable for management, restoration, and carbon budgets, which incorporate metabolism measurements at both the catchment and landscape scales. As metabolism datasets grow, future syntheses will address challenges including seasonality, sensor deployment time and location, hydrology, and variation in analytical conventions by discipline. Ongoing technological and computational advancements, combined with increased communication among subdisciplines, should also expand insights generated by subsequent metabolism syntheses.},

This balance took into account hydrological and biogeochemical processes affecting dissolved inorganic (DIC), dissolved organic (DOC) and particulate organic (POC) carbon species. Accumulation varied greatly on a seasonal and yearly basis. The lake exported carbon during most of the year except during spring floods and in late autumn. In-lake processes were responsible for exporting POC and storing DOC while DIC switched between storage and export. The carbon cycle was alternatively dominated in 2009 by biogeochemical processes and in 2011 by riverine fluxes, whereas in 2010 the two process types were of the same magnitude. These results suggest that the role of large shallow lakes like Võrtsjärv in the global C cycle is equally driven by hydrological factors, in particular seasonal water level changes, and by biogeochemical in-lake reactions.},

The central result of this article is a relation between time averaged GPP and the amplitude of the diel harmonic in an oxygen time series. We call this relation the Fourier method for estimating GPP. To assess the performance and accuracy of the method, we generate synthetic oxygen time series with a series of gradually more complex models, and compare the result with simulated GPP. We demonstrate that the method is applicable in systems with a range of rates of mixing, air–water exchange and primary production. We also apply the new method to oxygen time series from the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) and compare it with 14C-based GPP measurements. We demonstrate the Fourier method is particularly suited for estimating GPP in estuarine and coastal systems where tidal advection has a large imprint in observed oxygen concentrations. As such it enlarges the number of systems where GPP can be estimated from in situ oxygen concentrations. By shifting the focus to the frequency domain, we also gain some useful insights on the effect of observational error and of stochastic drivers of oxygen dynamics on metabolic estimates derived from oxygen time series.},

In order to assess spatial differences in metabolism estimates, the lake was divided into three geographical areas (North, Central, and South) and each area was subdivided into two biological zones (littoral and pelagic). A well-marked littoral to pelagic gradient was observed, with significant differences in the metabolism estimates between the biological zones of each compartment. In addition, a significant longitudinal difference in metabolism between the North and other lake areas was also apparent. Temporal dynamics featured continuous switching between net autotrophic and net heterotrophic conditions. Phytoplankton primary production and respiration were the main individual processes controlling gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, respectively, for the entire lake. Our findings indicated that spatially distributed estimates of lake metabolism led to different conclusions than did overall metabolism estimates based on single points. Also, individual processes must be taken into account in order to fully understand their relative importance on different spatial and temporal scales for the overall metabolism of aquatic ecosystems.},

We hypothesized that long-term averages of light-related variables would be better predictors of lake metabolism than nutrient-related variables. Model input parameters were in situ high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and irradiance. Model simulations were conducted for several (5–12) diel cycles for each lake during the summer season. Accounting for uncertainty, the results from the Bayesian model revealed that 2 lakes were autotrophic for the duration of the experiment, 1 was heterotrophic, and 5 were balanced or had an ambiguous metabolic state. Cross-comparison with a traditional bookkeeping model showed that the majority of lakes were in metabolic balance. A strong coupling between primary production and respiration was observed, with the share of autochthonous primary production respired by consumers increasing with light extinction and nutrient-related variables. Unlike gross primary production, community respiration was strongly related to light extinction, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus. These findings suggest that a drastic decrease in light-limited primary production along the DOC gradient counter-balanced nutrient supply in the darker lakes and thus blurred the relationship between primary production and nutrients. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, both light and nutrient-related variables seemed to be good predictors of lake respiration and its coupling to lake primary production.},

This was calibrated to high-resolution (15 min), long-term (2.5 years) dissolved oxygen (DO) time series for moorland and forest reaches of a third-order montane stream in Scotland. The model was multicriteria calibrated to continuous 24 h periods within the time series to identify behavioral simulations representative of ecosystem functioning. Results were evaluated using a seasonal regional sensitivity analysis and a colinearity index for parameter sensitivity. This showed that {\textgreater}95 \% of the behavioral models for the moorland and forest sites were identifiable and able to infer in-stream processes from the DO time series for around 40\% and 32\% of the time period, respectively. Monthly P/R ratios {\textless}1 indicate a heterotrophic system with both sites exhibiting similar temporal patterns; with a maximum in February and a second peak during summer months. However, the estimated net ecosystem productivity suggests that the moorland reach without riparian tree cover is likely to be a much larger source of carbon to the atmosphere (122 mmol C m−2 d−1) compared to the forested reach (64 mmol C m−2 d−1). We conclude that such process-based oxygen mass balance models may be transferable tools for investigating other systems; specifically, well-oxygenated upland channels with high hydraulic roughness and lacking reaeration measurements.},

	abstract = {Global changes, such as climate and land use alterations, are expected to affect freshwater ecosystems, modifying environmental conditions with ultimate effects on carbon and nutrient cycling. While effects of these changes have been the focus of several studies in temperate lakes, remarkably little effort has been dedicated to understanding the behaviour and responses of tropical lakes despite their importance in tropical environments. In a factorial mesocosm study conducted in a tropical lake, we investigated how changes in environmental conditions, such as additions of inorganic nutrients and allochthonous organic matter, and shading, affect gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (R) and net community production (NCP) rates, and the occurrence of GPP light saturation and photoinhibition. GPP rates in the mesocosms were enhanced by additions of inorganic nutrients (+NP) and organic matter (+C) and decreased with increasing mean light available (Ī). Apparent photoinhibition was pronounced in full light treatments (+L) without additions of nutrients (−NP) and organic matter (−C), occurring in 91\% of the experimental days. This supports previous evidence of the importance of photoinhibition in the upper mixed layer of the lake, especially during nutrient depletion and high light availability in the warmer rainy season. The main factor affecting metabolic rates was nutrients (NP), followed by organic matter (C). Effect of light (L) and the interaction between C and L were also significant for GPP and R rates. Addition of allochthonous organic matter (+C) with a high content of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) stimulated GPP rates and reduced the occurrence of apparent photoinhibition and light saturation. This also increased R rates in the mesocosms. However, R was strongly coupled to GPP, indicating that changes in respiration were more related to autotrophic activity than to a direct and independent stimulation of heterotrophic communities. Our results strongly support recent evidence of the interactions between nutrients, organic matter and light conditions, which under a scenario of changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation events and human-mediated changes in land use, may affect the magnitude, variability and balance of metabolic processes in the productive upper mixed layers of tropical lakes.},

	abstract = {Inverse modeling is a common practice to decompose observed processes into constituents that are unobservable or difficult to measure. To achieve this goal, a mechanistic model is calibrated to fit the observations and thereby the model produces a coherent set of constituent estimates. A disadvantage of this procedure is that any disagreement between the model assumptions and reality potentially introduces bias and other statistical artifacts into the constituents and their relations. Lake metabolism is recently most often followed by high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, and inverse modeling with simple conceptual models is used to couple oxygen dynamics to ecosystem-wide aggregated metabolic rates, such as net ecosystem production (NEP). These models rely on estimates of gas exchange and community respiration. Using a model of a simple ecosystem and field data, we demonstrate that typical relations between modeled metabolic rates frequently do not follow patterns expected from synthetic ecosystems and that estimation errors strongly influence calculations by producing strong, spurious correlations.

	abstract = {Twenty-three station-years of diel oxygen data for the James River Estuary were analyzed to characterize longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual patterns of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We compared two commonly used methods for deriving metabolism (bookkeeping and Bayesian) to determine whether the observed patterns were robust with respect to computational methodology. The two methods revealed similar longitudinal patterns of increasing GPP and ER, and decreasing net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), with increasing salinity. Seasonal patterns in GPP and ER tracked water temperature and solar radiation, except during high discharge events when metabolism declined by 40\%. The bookkeeping method yielded higher estimates of GPP and ER in the higher end of the range, and smaller estimates in the low end of the range, thereby accentuating seasonal and longitudinal differences. Inferences regarding net autotrophy and heterotrophy were robust, as both methods yielded positive estimates of NEM at the chlorophyll maximum (tidal fresh segment) and negative values for the saline portion of the estuary. Inferences regarding the relative importance of allochthonous inputs (based on inferred ER at GPP = 0) differed between the two methods. Values derived by the bookkeeping method indicated that respiration was largely supported by autochthonous production, whereas the Bayesian results indicated that autochthonous and allochthonous inputs were equally important. Overall, our findings show that methodological differences were small in the context of longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual variation but that the bookkeeping method yielded a wider range of values for GPP and ER relative to the Bayesian estimates.},

	abstract = {Under-ice dissolved oxygen (DO) metabolism and DO depletion are poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict how changing winter conditions will affect lake ecosystems. We analyzed under-ice DO dynamics based on high-frequency (HF) data at two depths (5 and 25 m) for three winters (January–March 2014, 2015, and 2016) in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (1178 m above sea level; maximum depth 39 m). Specifically, we assessed diel metabolic rates based on HF data of DO, temperature, and light for winter 2016 and seasonal DO depletion rates based on HF data of DO for all three winters. For 2016, calculations of metabolic rates were possible only for 34\% and 3\% of days at 5 and 25 m, respectively; these metabolic rates generally indicated net heterotrophy at both depths. Low success in modeling metabolic rates was attributed to low diel DO variability and anomalous diel DO patterns, probably linked to under-ice physical processes. Seasonal DO patterns for the three winters showed increasing, decreasing, or stable DO trends at 5 m while at 25 m patterns always showed decreasing DO trends but with different rates. Our multiyear study permitted us to hypothesize that the observed intraannual and interannual differences in DO depletion can be attributed to variable snow cover determining the penetration of radiation and thus photosynthesis. This study brings new insights to DO dynamics in ice-covered systems, highlights the challenges linked to under-ice lake metabolism, and advocates for a modeling approach that includes physical processes.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem metabolism is an integrative measure of the production and respiration of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. However, under-ice regions and mixing periods are infrequently sampled because of logistical challenges and assumptions of low biological activity, resulting in limited understanding of the contribution of winter epilimnetic metabolism to annual carbon cycling. Aquatic ecosystems can emit up to 76\% of the carbon they receive from terrestrial landscapes as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, making them significant contributors to Earth’s carbon cycle. Consequently, studying metabolism under ice is especially important given that warmer winters have already shortened ice cover and lengthened ice transitional periods, potentially resulting in greater carbon dioxide emissions. Using a continuous year of epilimnetic high-frequency dissolved oxygen data, we found that gross primary production was low but not absent under ice and increased during the end of the under-ice period. Despite cold water temperatures, under-ice respiration was 1.2 times higher than summer respiration, and ice-on and ice-off periods were important contributors to annual metabolism estimates. On average, under-ice net ecosystem production (NEP) was negative, in contrast to positive NEP for the spring and summer periods. Including winter metabolism estimates flipped annual NEP from autotrophy to heterotrophy, demonstrating that year-round sampling is essential for accurately assessing carbon cycling in lakes.},

	abstract = {A central organizing concept in estuarine biogeochemistry is net ecosystem production (NEP). However, estimates of seasonal and interannual variability of whole-system estuarine NEP, which provide insight into how estuaries respond to climatic and anthropogenic forcing, are rare. The main objectives of this study are to (1) determine the seasonal and interannual variability in whole-system NEP of Biscayne Bay, a subtropical, shallow estuary located in southeastern Florida, USA, and (2) determine the potential driving mechanisms of NEP in this estuary. We compute monthly NEP over more than 12 years by constructing the dissolved oxygen budget for the estuary from monthly snapshot oxygen survey data (i.e., collected once per month). High-frequency observations of oxygen in similar subtropical estuaries were used to quantify the error associated with the snapshot monthly sampling. Oxygen air–water exchange and NEP closely balanced each other, with the long-term mean NEP (± 2 standard errors) equal to − 5.3 ± 0.3 mol O2 m−2 year−1, indicating net heterotrophy. Significant seasonality was found, with lowest NEP in September. At monthly time scales, NEP was significantly positively correlated with chlorophyll and total phosphorus and significantly negatively correlated with canal flow. Interannual variability in NEP was substantial, and the bay temporarily shifted from net heterotrophy to net autotrophy after the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, probably in response to increases in nutrients from runoff and resuspension. These findings show that monthly oxygen surveys can be used to quantify whole-system estuarine NEP and that Biscayne Bay NEP is sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic forcing on seasonal and interannual timescales.},

	abstract = {Ecological stoichiometry is concerned with the ratios of different elements, particularly carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Ratios by their nature do not respond symmetrically to changes in the numerator and denominator and do not follow normal distributions; however, researchers frequently fail to consider these properties in their analyses, which has biased reported results. Calculating means, variance, or linear slopes based on untransformed ratios results in biased results. I demonstrate the consequences of these errors for inferences from stoichiometric analyses using simple examples and several large monitoring data sets. I then review 100 studies in ecological stoichiometry and find that misuse of ratio data is common, with 93\% of studies containing at least one error. These errors may be problematic, particularly in large-scale meta-analyses summarizing data over large ranges. Fortunately, most of these mistakes can be easily avoided by first log transforming elemental ratios. I therefore recommend that, to ensure robust and reproducible results, researchers in ecological stoichiometry should adopt a convention of presenting stoichiometric ratio data as the logarithm of molar ratios in the future. The widespread use of untransformed nitrogen to phosphorus ratio as an indicator of nutrient limitation has likely exaggerated the importance of phosphorus limitation, particularly in freshwater systems.},

We present a new approach to data-driven discovery of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs), in explicit or implicit form. We demonstrate our approach on a wide range of problems, including shallow water equations and Navier–Stokes equations. The key idea is to select candidate terms for the underlying equations using dimensional analysis, and to approximate the weights of the terms with error bars using our threshold sparse Bayesian regression. This new algorithm employs Bayesian inference to tune the hyperparameters automatically. Our approach is effective, robust and able to quantify uncertainties by providing an error bar for each discovered candidate equation. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through a collection of classical ODEs and PDEs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm with respect to noisy data and its ability to discover various candidate equations with error bars that represent the quantified uncertainties. Detailed comparisons with the sequential threshold least-squares algorithm and the lasso algorithm are studied from noisy time-series measurements and indicate that the proposed method provides more robust and accurate results. In addition, the data-driven prediction of dynamics with error bars using discovered governing physical laws is more accurate and robust than classical polynomial regressions.},

These ecosystem components not only change over time but also interact with each other. Therefore, investigation of individual relationships may give limited insights into their interdependencies and limit ability to predict future ecosystem states. We address this problem by analyzing long-term (16–39 years) time series data from 10 aquatic ecosystems and using convergent cross mapping (CCM) to quantify the causal networks linking phytoplankton species richness, biomass, and physicochemical factors. We determined that individual quantities (e.g., total species richness or nutrients) were not significant predictors of ecosystem stability (quantified as long-term fluctuation of phytoplankton biomass); rather, the integrated causal pathway in the ecosystem network, composed of the interactions among species richness, nutrient cycling, and phytoplankton biomass, was the best predictor of stability. Furthermore, systems that experienced stronger warming over time had both weakened causal interactions and larger fluctuations. Thus, rather than thinking in terms of separate factors, a more holistic network view, that causally links species richness and the other ecosystem components, is required to understand and predict climate impacts on the temporal stability of aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {An important approach for scientific inquiry across many disciplines involves using observational time series data to understand the relationships between key variables to gain mechanistic insights into the underlying rules that govern the given system. In real systems, such as those found in ecology, the relationships between time series variables are generally not static; instead, these relationships are dynamical and change in a nonlinear or state-dependent manner. To further understand such systems, we investigate integrating methods that appropriately characterize these dynamics (i.e., methods that measure interactions as they change with time-varying system states) with visualization techniques that can help analyze the behavior of the system. Here, we focus on empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a state-of-the-art method that specifically identifies causal variables and measures changing state-dependent relationships between time series variables. Instead of using approaches centered on parametric equations, EDM is an equation-free approach that studies systems based on their dynamic attractors. We propose a visual analytics system to support the identification and mechanistic interpretation of system states using an EDM-constructed dynamic graph. This work, as detailed in four analysis tasks and demonstrated with a GUI, provides a novel synthesis of EDM and visualization techniques such as brush-link visualization and visual summarization to interpret dynamic graphs representing ecosystem dynamics. We applied our proposed system to ecological simulation data and real data from a marine mesocosm study as two key use cases. Our case studies show that our visual analytics tools support the identification and interpretation of the system state by the user, and enable us to discover both confirmatory and new findings in ecosystem dynamics. Overall, we demonstrated that our system can facilitate an understanding of how systems function beyond the intuitive analysis of high-dimensional information based on specific domain knowledge.},

              Globally, lake surface water temperatures have warmed rapidly relative to air temperatures, but changes in deepwater temperatures and vertical thermal structure are still largely unknown. We have compiled the most comprehensive data set to date of long-term (1970–2009) summertime vertical temperature profiles in lakes across the world to examine trends and drivers of whole-lake vertical thermal structure. We found significant increases in surface water temperatures across lakes at an average rate of + 0.37 °C decade
              −1
              , comparable to changes reported previously for other lakes, and similarly consistent trends of increasing water column stability (+ 0.08 kg m
              −3
              decade
              −1
              ). In contrast, however, deepwater temperature trends showed little change on average (+ 0.06 °C decade
              −1
              ), but had high variability across lakes, with trends in individual lakes ranging from − 0.68 °C decade
              −1
              to + 0.65 °C decade
              −1
              . The variability in deepwater temperature trends was not explained by trends in either surface water temperatures or thermal stability within lakes, and only 8.4\% was explained by lake thermal region or local lake characteristics in a random forest analysis. These findings suggest that external drivers beyond our tested lake characteristics are important in explaining long-term trends in thermal structure, such as local to regional climate patterns or additional external anthropogenic influences.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the production and consumption of organic material have been a focus of aquatic science for more than 80 years. Over the last century, a variety of approaches have been developed and employed for measuring rates of gross primary production (Pg), respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (Pn = Pg − R) within aquatic ecosystems. Here, we reconsider the range of approaches and applications for ecosystem metabolism measurements, and suggest ways by which such studies can continue to contribute to aquatic ecology. This paper reviews past and contemporary studies of aquatic ecosystem-level metabolism to identify their role in understanding and managing aquatic systems. We identify four broad research objectives that have motivated ecosystem metabolism studies: (1) quantifying magnitude and variability of metabolic rates for cross-system comparison, (2) estimating organic matter transfer between adjacent systems or subsystems, (3) measuring ecosystem-scale responses to perturbation, both natural and anthropogenic, and (4) quantifying and calibrating models of biogeochemical processes and trophic networks. The magnitudes of whole-system gross primary production, respiration and net ecosystem production rates vary among aquatic environments and are partly constrained by the chosen methodology. We argue that measurements of ecosystem metabolism should be a vital component of routine monitoring at larger scales in the aquatic environment using existing flexible, precise, and durable sensor technologies. Current and future aquatic ecosystem studies will benefit from application of new methods for metabolism measurements, which facilitate integration of process measurements and calibration of models for addressing fundamental questions involving ecosystem-scale processes.},

Averaged over the deployment, aerial metabolism estimates among sensor locations varied 1–2 orders of magnitude and were largely unrelated to physical habitat within the lake. For all sites and days, 76–90\% of the explainable variance in GPP and R was attributable to location in the lake rather than day of the deployment. NEP, on the other hand, was less affected by location, with 79–93\% of the explained variance attributable to the day of the deployment. Single-location estimates can yield errors of more than an order of magnitude in estimates of daily GPP and R and can mischaracterize the trophic status of the lake. Using a rarefaction approach, we found that using four randomly placed sensors increased the precision of the resulting daily metabolism estimates fourfold over single-location measures in both lakes.},

	abstract = {Twenty-three station-years of diel oxygen data for the James River Estuary were analyzed to characterize longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual patterns of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We compared two commonly used methods for deriving metabolism (bookkeeping and Bayesian) to determine whether the observed patterns were robust with respect to computational methodology. The two methods revealed similar longitudinal patterns of increasing GPP and ER, and decreasing net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), with increasing salinity. Seasonal patterns in GPP and ER tracked water temperature and solar radiation, except during high discharge events when metabolism declined by 40\%. The bookkeeping method yielded higher estimates of GPP and ER in the higher end of the range, and smaller estimates in the low end of the range, thereby accentuating seasonal and longitudinal differences. Inferences regarding net autotrophy and heterotrophy were robust, as both methods yielded positive estimates of NEM at the chlorophyll maximum (tidal fresh segment) and negative values for the saline portion of the estuary. Inferences regarding the relative importance of allochthonous inputs (based on inferred ER at GPP = 0) differed between the two methods. Values derived by the bookkeeping method indicated that respiration was largely supported by autochthonous production, whereas the Bayesian results indicated that autochthonous and allochthonous inputs were equally important. Overall, our findings show that methodological differences were small in the context of longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual variation but that the bookkeeping method yielded a wider range of values for GPP and ER relative to the Bayesian estimates.},

Few syntheses of aquatic ecosystem metabolism have been completed since. We used Odum's conceptual framework to compare GPP and ER from open-water diel oxygen curves in lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and streams (n = 350). We also documented environmental drivers of metabolism among ecosystems. GPP and ER were strongly related in lakes and estuaries, but weakly related in streams and wetlands. GPP and ER were highest in estuaries, and GPP : ER was lowest in streams. Differences in the magnitude and variability of metabolism among ecosystems were attributable to landscape and water-column factors. Watershed size and phosphorus (P) concentrations were positively related to GPP and ER across all ecosystems. Considered independently, lake and estuary GPP were driven by P concentrations. In contrast, land-use and canopy cover drove stream metabolism, not nutrient concentrations. Results confirmed the classic paradigm that estuaries are the most productive aquatic ecosystem; however, our synthesis showed that relative to streams and estuaries, there was higher variation in lake GPP and ER than previously documented. Results will be valuable for management, restoration, and carbon budgets, which incorporate metabolism measurements at both the catchment and landscape scales. As metabolism datasets grow, future syntheses will address challenges including seasonality, sensor deployment time and location, hydrology, and variation in analytical conventions by discipline. Ongoing technological and computational advancements, combined with increased communication among subdisciplines, should also expand insights generated by subsequent metabolism syntheses.},

Parallel increases in concentration across the seven lakes during drought were attributable to evapoconcentration.

Ca+Mg mass increased in three groundwater-dominated lakes as precipitation inputs were low and groundwater discharging from longer flowpaths became proportionately more important. In contrast, decreases in Ca+Mg mass for two precipitation-dominated lakes reflected diminished inputs of solute-rich groundwater.

We fit Bayesian hierarchical models to thousands of observations from over two decades to quantify four components of variation – spatial (local and regional) and temporal (local and coherent); and to model their drivers. We found strong support for three propositions: (1) spatial variation at local and regional scales are large and roughly equal, (2) annual temporal variation is mostly local rather than coherent, and, (3) spatial variation exceeds temporal variation. Our findings imply that predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes at macroscales requires consideration of the dominant spatial signals at both local and regional scales that may overwhelm temporal signals.},

We develop a simple equilibrium model within a Bayesian framework that exploits the differences among the lakes to estimate three key rates: aerial loading (AOC) and wetland loading (WOC) from adjacent ecosystems and whole-lake mineralization of OC (RDOC). Combined with observational data, these rates allow for estimates of the total OC loads, mineralization, and sedimentation within lakes and export to downstream ecosystems. AOC was 1.15 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, WOC ranged from 0.72 to 3.00 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, and RDOC, normalized to 20°C, ranged from 0.00083 to 0.0015 d−1. Total loads ranged from about 5 to 55 g C m−2 yr−1. Ecosystems immediately adjacent to lakes accounted for one-half or more of total OC loads for some lakes. Whether a lake processed and stored more allochthonous OC than it exported depended primarily on hydrologic residence time. Our equilibrium model provides a parsimonious approach to quantifying allochthonous OC budgets in lakes with relatively minimal baseline data.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 °C during the test period (DL: 1.78 °C, PB: 2.03 °C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.},

	abstract = {The Livingstone and Imboden (1996) model for the oxygen depletion rate in lake hypolimnia was evaluated with field results in 32 lakes. The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

In order to assess spatial differences in metabolism estimates, the lake was divided into three geographical areas (North, Central, and South) and each area was subdivided into two biological zones (littoral and pelagic). A well-marked littoral to pelagic gradient was observed, with significant differences in the metabolism estimates between the biological zones of each compartment. In addition, a significant longitudinal difference in metabolism between the North and other lake areas was also apparent. Temporal dynamics featured continuous switching between net autotrophic and net heterotrophic conditions. Phytoplankton primary production and respiration were the main individual processes controlling gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, respectively, for the entire lake. Our findings indicated that spatially distributed estimates of lake metabolism led to different conclusions than did overall metabolism estimates based on single points. Also, individual processes must be taken into account in order to fully understand their relative importance on different spatial and temporal scales for the overall metabolism of aquatic ecosystems.},

Conversely, the observed curves of oxygen in streams can be used to calculate the component rates of production, respiration, and diffusion. New production values obtained with these analyses of oxygen curves from various sources, as well as a few previously existing estimates of primary production, indicate a generally higher rate of production in flowing waters than in other types of aquatic environments. The ratio of total primary production to total community respiration is used to classify communities quantitatively according to their predominantly heterotrophic or autotrophic characteristics. Longitudinal succession within a stream tends to modify the ratio towards unity from higher values for autotrophic and from lower values for heterotrophic communities. The behavior of this ratio is described for the annual cycle in a stream, for the sequence of pollution recovery, and for diverse types of communities.},

	abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

This was calibrated to high-resolution (15 min), long-term (2.5 years) dissolved oxygen (DO) time series for moorland and forest reaches of a third-order montane stream in Scotland. The model was multicriteria calibrated to continuous 24 h periods within the time series to identify behavioral simulations representative of ecosystem functioning. Results were evaluated using a seasonal regional sensitivity analysis and a colinearity index for parameter sensitivity. This showed that {\textgreater}95 \% of the behavioral models for the moorland and forest sites were identifiable and able to infer in-stream processes from the DO time series for around 40\% and 32\% of the time period, respectively. Monthly P/R ratios {\textless}1 indicate a heterotrophic system with both sites exhibiting similar temporal patterns; with a maximum in February and a second peak during summer months. However, the estimated net ecosystem productivity suggests that the moorland reach without riparian tree cover is likely to be a much larger source of carbon to the atmosphere (122 mmol C m−2 d−1) compared to the forested reach (64 mmol C m−2 d−1). We conclude that such process-based oxygen mass balance models may be transferable tools for investigating other systems; specifically, well-oxygenated upland channels with high hydraulic roughness and lacking reaeration measurements.},

Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

All lakes underwent an abrupt increase in VWHO and mean hypolimnetic DO after 2010. In four of the six study lakes, the highest hypolimnetic DO concentrations were observed in years where chlorophyll a concentrations were low, whereas at ﬁve of the six study lakes the highest hypolimnetic volumes were observed when dissolved organic carbon concentrations were relatively high. Warmer spring or winter air temperatures were associated with higher hypolimnetic DO concentrations at two sites, and longer ice-free periods were associated with smaller hypolimnetic volumes at two sites.

	abstract = {Recent literature has suggested that for many lakes and rivers, the respiratory breakdown of organic matter (R) exceeds production of organic matter by photosynthesis (gross primary production [GPP]) within the water body. This metabolic balance (GPP {\textgreater} R; “heterotrophy”) implies that allochthonous organic matter supports a portion of the aquatic ecosystem's respiration. Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of lake types studied, especially with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are two reasons for differing conclusions. We deployed O2 and CO2 sondes to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 lakes. From these data, we calculated GPP, R, and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP − R). Over the broad range in TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O2 changed on a near 1 : 1 molar ratio. Metabolism estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set had negative NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were nearly equal, but, at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had negative NEP. Strong correlations between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon influences lake metabolism.},

Wetland and lake contributions to regional C cycling remain relatively uncertain despite recent research highlighting their importance. Using a combination of field surveys and tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, modeling, and published literature, we constructed a complete C budget for the Northern Highlands Lake District in northern Wisconsin/Michigan, a ∼6400 km2 region rich in lakes and wetlands. This is one of the first regional C budgets to incorporate aquatic and terrestrial C cycling under the same framework. We divided the landscape into three major compartments (forests, wetlands, and surface waters) and quantified all major C fluxes into and out of those compartments, with a particular focus on atmospheric exchange but also including sedimentation in lakes and hydrologic fluxes. Landscape C storage was dominated by peat-containing wetlands and lake sediments, which make up only 20\% and 13\% of the landscape area, respectively, but contain {\textgreater}80\% of the total fixed C pool (ca. 400 Tg). We estimated a current regional C accumulation of 1.1±0.1 Tg yr−1, and the largest regional flux was forest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into aggrading forests for a total of 1.0±0.1 Tg yr−1. Mean wetland NEE (0.12±0.06 Tg yr−1 into wetlands), lake CO2 emissions and riverine efflux (each ca. 0.03±0.01 Tg yr−1) were smaller but of consequence to the overall budget. Hydrologic transport from uplands/wetlands to surface waters within the region was an important vector of terrestrial C. Regional C fluxes and pools would be misrepresented without inclusion of surface waters and wetlands, and C budgets in heterogeneous landscapes open opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important fluxes to changes in climate and land use/land cover.},

	abstract = {Global changes, such as climate and land use alterations, are expected to affect freshwater ecosystems, modifying environmental conditions with ultimate effects on carbon and nutrient cycling. While effects of these changes have been the focus of several studies in temperate lakes, remarkably little effort has been dedicated to understanding the behaviour and responses of tropical lakes despite their importance in tropical environments. In a factorial mesocosm study conducted in a tropical lake, we investigated how changes in environmental conditions, such as additions of inorganic nutrients and allochthonous organic matter, and shading, affect gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (R) and net community production (NCP) rates, and the occurrence of GPP light saturation and photoinhibition. GPP rates in the mesocosms were enhanced by additions of inorganic nutrients (+NP) and organic matter (+C) and decreased with increasing mean light available (Ī). Apparent photoinhibition was pronounced in full light treatments (+L) without additions of nutrients (−NP) and organic matter (−C), occurring in 91\% of the experimental days. This supports previous evidence of the importance of photoinhibition in the upper mixed layer of the lake, especially during nutrient depletion and high light availability in the warmer rainy season. The main factor affecting metabolic rates was nutrients (NP), followed by organic matter (C). Effect of light (L) and the interaction between C and L were also significant for GPP and R rates. Addition of allochthonous organic matter (+C) with a high content of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) stimulated GPP rates and reduced the occurrence of apparent photoinhibition and light saturation. This also increased R rates in the mesocosms. However, R was strongly coupled to GPP, indicating that changes in respiration were more related to autotrophic activity than to a direct and independent stimulation of heterotrophic communities. Our results strongly support recent evidence of the interactions between nutrients, organic matter and light conditions, which under a scenario of changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation events and human-mediated changes in land use, may affect the magnitude, variability and balance of metabolic processes in the productive upper mixed layers of tropical lakes.},

The models used to estimate metabolism often subsume biological processes into one parameter each for GPP and R. However, high-frequency DO observations made over days show diverse patterns at multiple time scales, suggesting a complex suite of processes controls DO dynamics. Can we improve metabolism estimates and predictive ability for DO at diel scales by adding complexity to the models? In this study, we use data from two north temperate lakes to test a variety of metabolism models representing a suite of non-linear metabolic processes. To test whether alternative models can be discriminated, we simulated DO with assumed parameter values and auto-regressive noise, and fit the models to the simulated DO. The most complex model could be discriminated from simpler models and provided the most accurate and precise predictions. However, when models were fit to observed DO data from the sensor network, the simplest model predicted DO as well as the most complex one. The added complexity did not improve model performance. An analysis of the model residuals indicates that physics may explain some of the DO pattern not predicted, especially high-frequency oscillations and anomalies that appear to coincide with weather patterns. Under reasonably stable weather conditions and at scales of a few days, simple metabolism models explain the bulk of diel DO variability.},

The central result of this article is a relation between time averaged GPP and the amplitude of the diel harmonic in an oxygen time series. We call this relation the Fourier method for estimating GPP. To assess the performance and accuracy of the method, we generate synthetic oxygen time series with a series of gradually more complex models, and compare the result with simulated GPP. We demonstrate that the method is applicable in systems with a range of rates of mixing, air–water exchange and primary production. We also apply the new method to oxygen time series from the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) and compare it with 14C-based GPP measurements. We demonstrate the Fourier method is particularly suited for estimating GPP in estuarine and coastal systems where tidal advection has a large imprint in observed oxygen concentrations. As such it enlarges the number of systems where GPP can be estimated from in situ oxygen concentrations. By shifting the focus to the frequency domain, we also gain some useful insights on the effect of observational error and of stochastic drivers of oxygen dynamics on metabolic estimates derived from oxygen time series.},

	abstract = {Inverse modeling is a common practice to decompose observed processes into constituents that are unobservable or difficult to measure. To achieve this goal, a mechanistic model is calibrated to fit the observations and thereby the model produces a coherent set of constituent estimates. A disadvantage of this procedure is that any disagreement between the model assumptions and reality potentially introduces bias and other statistical artifacts into the constituents and their relations. Lake metabolism is recently most often followed by high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, and inverse modeling with simple conceptual models is used to couple oxygen dynamics to ecosystem-wide aggregated metabolic rates, such as net ecosystem production (NEP). These models rely on estimates of gas exchange and community respiration. Using a model of a simple ecosystem and field data, we demonstrate that typical relations between modeled metabolic rates frequently do not follow patterns expected from synthetic ecosystems and that estimation errors strongly influence calculations by producing strong, spurious correlations. Correlation artifacts can be expected during inverse modeling, whenever observed time series are decomposed into poorly known or unmeasured processes that can compensate for the effect of each other.},

We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) for up to a full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0.1 to 5.0 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5\% to 85\% of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Background respiration ranged from 0.017 to 2.1 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and was positively related to indicators of recalcitrant allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter loads, but was not clearly related to an indicator of the quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs.},

We analyzed under-ice DO dynamics based on high-frequency (HF) data at two depths (5 and 25 m) for three winters (January–March 2014, 2015, and 2016) in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (1178 m above sea level; maximum depth 39 m). Specifically, we assessed diel metabolic rates based on HF data of DO, temperature, and light for winter 2016 and seasonal DO depletion rates based on HF data of DO for all three winters. For 2016, calculations of metabolic rates were possible only for 34\% and 3\% of days at 5 and 25 m, respectively; these metabolic rates generally indicated net heterotrophy at both depths. Low success in modeling metabolic rates was attributed to low diel DO variability and anomalous diel DO patterns, probably linked to under-ice physical processes. Seasonal DO patterns for the three winters showed increasing, decreasing, or stable DO trends at 5 m while at 25 m patterns always showed decreasing DO trends but with different rates. Our multiyear study permitted us to hypothesize that the observed intraannual and interannual differences in DO depletion can be attributed to variable snow cover determining the penetration of radiation and thus photosynthesis. This study brings new insights to DO dynamics in ice-covered systems, highlights the challenges linked to under-ice lake metabolism, and advocates for a modeling approach that includes physical processes.},

Accumulation varied greatly on a seasonal and yearly basis. The lake exported carbon during most of the year except during spring floods and in late autumn. In-lake processes were responsible for exporting POC and storing DOC while DIC switched between storage and export. The carbon cycle was alternatively dominated in 2009 by biogeochemical processes and in 2011 by riverine fluxes, whereas in 2010 the two process types were of the same magnitude. These results suggest that the role of large shallow lakes like Võrtsjärv in the global C cycle is equally driven by hydrological factors, in particular seasonal water level changes, and by biogeochemical in-lake reactions.},

	abstract = {Many lakes exhibit seasonal stratification, during which they develop strong thermal and chemical gradients. An expansion of depth-integrated monitoring programs has provided insight into the importance of organic carbon processing that occurs below the upper mixed layer. However, the chemical and physical drivers of metabolism and metabolic coupling remain unresolved, especially in the metalimnion. In this depth zone, sharp gradients in key resources such as light and temperature co-occur with dynamic physical conditions that influence metabolic processes directly and simultaneously hamper the accurate tracing of biological activity. We evaluated the drivers of metalimnetic metabolism and its associated uncertainty across 10 stratified lakes in Europe and North America. We hypothesized that the metalimnion would contribute highly to whole-lake functioning in clear oligotrophic lakes, and that metabolic rates would be highly variable in unstable polymictic lakes. Depth-integrated rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were modelled from diel dissolved oxygen curves using a Bayesian approach. Metabolic estimates were more uncertain below the epilimnion, but uncertainty was not consistently related to lake morphology or mixing regime. Metalimnetic rates exhibited high day-to-day variability in all trophic states, with the metalimnetic contribution to daily whole-lake GPP and ER ranging from 0\% to 87\% and {\textless} 1\% to 92\%, respectively. Nonetheless, the metalimnion of low-nutrient lakes contributed strongly to whole-lake metabolism on average, driven by a collinear combination of highlight, low surface-water phosphorous concentration and high metalimnetic volume. Consequently, a single-sensor approach does not necessarily reflect whole-ecosystem carbon dynamics in stratified lakes.},

Model simulations were conducted for several (5–12) diel cycles for each lake during the summer season. Accounting for uncertainty, the results from the Bayesian model revealed that 2 lakes were autotrophic for the duration of the experiment, 1 was heterotrophic, and 5 were balanced or had an ambiguous metabolic state. Cross-comparison with a traditional bookkeeping model showed that the majority of lakes were in metabolic balance. A strong coupling between primary production and respiration was observed, with the share of autochthonous primary production respired by consumers increasing with light extinction and nutrient-related variables. Unlike gross primary production, community respiration was strongly related to light extinction, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus. These findings suggest that a drastic decrease in light-limited primary production along the DOC gradient counter-balanced nutrient supply in the darker lakes and thus blurred the relationship between primary production and nutrients. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, both light and nutrient-related variables seemed to be good predictors of lake respiration and its coupling to lake primary production.},

Averaged over the deployment, aerial metabolism estimates among sensor locations varied 1–2 orders of magnitude and were largely unrelated to physical habitat within the lake. For all sites and days, 76–90\% of the explainable variance in GPP and R was attributable to location in the lake rather than day of the deployment. NEP, on the other hand, was less affected by location, with 79–93\% of the explained variance attributable to the day of the deployment. Single-location estimates can yield errors of more than an order of magnitude in estimates of daily GPP and R and can mischaracterize the trophic status of the lake. Using a rarefaction approach, we found that using four randomly placed sensors increased the precision of the resulting daily metabolism estimates fourfold over single-location measures in both lakes.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 °C during the test period (DL: 1.78 °C, PB: 2.03 °C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.},

The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

We develop a simple equilibrium model within a Bayesian framework that exploits the differences among the lakes to estimate three key rates: aerial loading (AOC) and wetland loading (WOC) from adjacent ecosystems and whole-lake mineralization of OC (RDOC). Combined with observational data, these rates allow for estimates of the total OC loads, mineralization, and sedimentation within lakes and export to downstream ecosystems. AOC was 1.15 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, WOC ranged from 0.72 to 3.00 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, and RDOC, normalized to 20°C, ranged from 0.00083 to 0.0015 d−1. Total loads ranged from about 5 to 55 g C m−2 yr−1. Ecosystems immediately adjacent to lakes accounted for one-half or more of total OC loads for some lakes. Whether a lake processed and stored more allochthonous OC than it exported depended primarily on hydrologic residence time. Our equilibrium model provides a parsimonious approach to quantifying allochthonous OC budgets in lakes with relatively minimal baseline data.},

	abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

	abstract = {Recent literature has suggested that for many lakes and rivers, the respiratory breakdown of organic matter (R) exceeds production of organic matter by photosynthesis (gross primary production [GPP]) within the water body. This metabolic balance (GPP {\textgreater} R; “heterotrophy”) implies that allochthonous organic matter supports a portion of the aquatic ecosystem's respiration. Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of lake types studied, especially with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are two reasons for differing conclusions. We deployed O2 and CO2 sondes to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 lakes. From these data, we calculated GPP, R, and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP − R). Over the broad range in TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O2 changed on a near 1 : 1 molar ratio. Metabolism estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set had negative NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were nearly equal, but, at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had negative NEP. Strong correlations between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon influences lake metabolism.},

The models used to estimate metabolism often subsume biological processes into one parameter each for GPP and R. However, high-frequency DO observations made over days show diverse patterns at multiple time scales, suggesting a complex suite of processes controls DO dynamics. Can we improve metabolism estimates and predictive ability for DO at diel scales by adding complexity to the models? In this study, we use data from two north temperate lakes to test a variety of metabolism models representing a suite of non-linear metabolic processes. To test whether alternative models can be discriminated, we simulated DO with assumed parameter values and auto-regressive noise, and fit the models to the simulated DO. The most complex model could be discriminated from simpler models and provided the most accurate and precise predictions. However, when models were fit to observed DO data from the sensor network, the simplest model predicted DO as well as the most complex one. The added complexity did not improve model performance. An analysis of the model residuals indicates that physics may explain some of the DO pattern not predicted, especially high-frequency oscillations and anomalies that appear to coincide with weather patterns. Under reasonably stable weather conditions and at scales of a few days, simple metabolism models explain the bulk of diel DO variability.},

	abstract = {The development of complete regional carbon (C) budgets for different biomes is an integral step in the effort to predict global response and potential feedbacks to a changing climate regime. Wetland and lake contributions to regional C cycling remain relatively uncertain despite recent research highlighting their importance. Using a combination of field surveys and tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, modeling, and published literature, we constructed a complete C budget for the Northern Highlands Lake District in northern Wisconsin/Michigan, a ∼6400 km2 region rich in lakes and wetlands. This is one of the first regional C budgets to incorporate aquatic and terrestrial C cycling under the same framework. We divided the landscape into three major compartments (forests, wetlands, and surface waters) and quantified all major C fluxes into and out of those compartments, with a particular focus on atmospheric exchange but also including sedimentation in lakes and hydrologic fluxes. Landscape C storage was dominated by peat-containing wetlands and lake sediments, which make up only 20\% and 13\% of the landscape area, respectively, but contain {\textgreater}80\% of the total fixed C pool (ca. 400 Tg). We estimated a current regional C accumulation of 1.1±0.1 Tg yr−1, and the largest regional flux was forest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into aggrading forests for a total of 1.0±0.1 Tg yr−1. Mean wetland NEE (0.12±0.06 Tg yr−1 into wetlands), lake CO2 emissions and riverine efflux (each ca. 0.03±0.01 Tg yr−1) were smaller but of consequence to the overall budget. Hydrologic transport from uplands/wetlands to surface waters within the region was an important vector of terrestrial C. Regional C fluxes and pools would be misrepresented without inclusion of surface waters and wetlands, and C budgets in heterogeneous landscapes open opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important fluxes to changes in climate and land use/land cover.},

	abstract = {We assembled data from a global network of automated lake observatories to test hypotheses regarding the drivers of ecosystem metabolism. We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) for up to a full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0.1 to 5.0 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5\% to 85\% of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Background respiration ranged from 0.017 to 2.1 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and was positively related to indicators of recalcitrant allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter loads, but was not clearly related to an indicator of the quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs.},

Theoretical and empirically based models of k range in complexity from wind-driven power functions to complex surface renewal models; however, model choice is rarely considered in most studies of lake metabolism. This study used high-frequency data from 15 lakes provided by the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) to study how model choice of k influenced estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere. We tested 6 models of k on lakes chosen to span broad gradients in surface area and trophic states; a metabolism model was then fit to all 6 outputs of k data. We found that hourly values for k were substantially different between models and, at an annual scale, resulted in significantly different estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere.},

To do so, this study integrated 6 yr of eddy-covariance flux tower observations of lake-atmosphere fluxes with high-frequency observations of in-lake temperature, dissolved oxygen, and partial pressure of CO2, for a eutrophic lake in Wisconsin, U.S.A. While growing season fluxes are variable and switch between source and sink, annual net carbon fluxes show the lake acts as an annual sink of carbon, with the magnitude depending on climate, along with the timing and strength of fall turnover, with half of the total annual carbon uptake happening in October and November.},

They undergo seasonal changes resulting in an array of temperature and oxygen conditions; oxic-low, oxic-high, anoxic-low, and anoxic-high temperature. We sought to understand the interaction of temperature and oxygen conditions on benthic solutes exchange through a two-factorial sediment core incubation experiment by varying either temperature or oxygen conditions of sediment cores from an oligotrophic and eutrophic reservoir. Temperature and oxygen conditions are both important for nutrient release; however, they influence solutes differently; differences in the fluxes of the treatments were explained more by temperature for P, DOC and N, while for Fe, Mn and SO42−, differences were explained more by oxygen conditions. The combination of strongly reducing conditions (due to anoxia) and high temperature (20 °C) led to a significant increase in nutrients concentrations in the overlying water. Under these conditions, SRP flux was 0.04 and 0.5 mmol m−2 d−1; ammonium was 0.9 and 5.6 mmol m−2 d−1 for the oligotrophic and eutrophic reservoir, respectively. We observed a synergistic interaction between temperature and oxygen conditions which resulted in release of solutes from sediments. An increase in nutrients release under increasing temperatures is more likely and so are algal blooms.},

P inputs included fertilizer for agricultural crops and lawns, dietary supplements for dairy cattle, and natural inputs such as dry and wet deposition. Outputs included agricultural crops, livestock and livestock products, and hydrologic export to Lake Mendota. The total P input to the watershed (1,307,000 kg year−1) and total output (732,000 kg year−1) are large relative to the average of 34,000 kg P washing into the lake each year, indicating that the P flux that eutrophies Lake Mendota is a veryminor component of the total watershed P budget. Using the formula inputs−outputs = change in storage, we found that 575,000 kg P accumulated in the watershed in 1995. This estimate was corroborated by long-term soil P concentration data, which showed an average annual increase in soil P of over 450,000 kg year−1. Future management programs designed to reduce P inputs to Lake Mendota will be compelled to cope with the large amount of P being stored in the watershed.},

Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

	abstract = {How to model a pair of sentences is a critical issue in many NLP tasks such as answer selection (AS), paraphrase identification (PI) and textual entailment (TE). Most prior work (i) deals with one individual task by fine-tuning a specific system; (ii) models each sentence’s representation separately, rarely considering the impact of the other sentence; or (iii) relies fully on manually designed, task-specific linguistic features. This work presents a general Attention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a pair of sentences. We make three contributions. (i) The ABCNN can be applied to a wide variety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs. (ii) We propose three attention schemes that integrate mutual influence between sentences into CNNs; thus, the representation of each sentence takes into consideration its counterpart. These interdependent sentence pair representations are more powerful than isolated sentence representations. (iii) ABCNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on AS, PI and TE tasks.

	abstract = {Having insight into the causal associations in a complex system facilitates decision making, e.g., for medical treatments, urban infrastructure improvements or financial investments. The amount of observational data grows, which enables the discovery of causal relationships between variables from observation of their behaviour in time. Existing methods for causal discovery from time series data do not yet exploit the representational power of deep learning. We therefore present the Temporal Causal Discovery Framework (TCDF), a deep learning framework that learns a causal graph structure by discovering causal relationships in observational time series data. TCDF uses attention-based convolutional neural networks combined with a causal validation step. By interpreting the internal parameters of the convolutional networks, TCDF can also discover the time delay between a cause and the occurrence of its effect. Our framework learns temporal causal graphs, which can include confounders and instantaneous effects. Experiments on financial and neuroscientific benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance of TCDF on discovering causal relationships in continuous time series data. Furthermore, we show that TCDF can circumstantially discover the presence of hidden confounders. Our broadly applicable framework can be used to gain novel insights into the causal dependencies in a complex system, which is important for reliable predictions, knowledge discovery and data-driven decision making.},

              2
              pool due to its large size, it does play an important role in freshwater and marine nitrogen (N) cycling. N-fixation converts N
              2
              to ammonia, which can be used by microbes and phytoplankton, while denitrification/anammox effectively removes it by converting oxidized, inorganic N to N

              . We examined N
              2
              saturation to infer net biological nitrogen processes in 34 lakes across 5° latitude varying in trophic status, mixing regime, and bathymetry. Here, we report that nearly all lakes examined in the upper Midwest (USA) were supersaturated with N

              n

The traditional paradigm is that freshwaters compensate for N-limitation through N-fixation, but these results indicate that lakes were constantly losing N to the atmosphere via denitrification and/or anammox, suggesting that terrestrial N inputs are needed to balance the internal N cycle.},

	abstract = {Deep-learning techniques appear to be poised to play very important roles in our processing flows for inversion and interpretation of seismic data. The most successful seismic applications of these complex pattern-identifying networks will, presumably, be those that also leverage the deterministic physical models on which we normally base our seismic interpretations. If this is true, algorithms belonging to theory-guided data science, whose aim is roughly this, will have particular applicability in our field. We have developed a theory-designed recurrent neural network (RNN) that allows single- and multidimensional scalar acoustic seismic forward-modeling problems to be set up in terms of its forward propagation. We find that training such a network and updating its weights using measured seismic data then amounts to a solution of the seismic inverse problem and is equivalent to gradient-based seismic full-waveform inversion (FWI). By refining these RNNs in terms of optimization method and learning rate, comparisons are made between standard deep-learning optimization and nonlinear conjugate gradient and limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimized algorithms. Our numerical analysis indicates that adaptive moment (or Adam) optimization with a learning rate set to match the magnitudes of standard FWI updates appears to produce the most stable and well-behaved waveform inversion results, which is reconfirmed by a multidimensional 2D Marmousi experiment. Future waveform RNNs, with additional degrees of freedom, may allow optimal wave propagation rules to be solved for at the same time as medium properties, reducing modeling errors.},

	abstract = {Enhanced phosphorus (P) export from land into streams and lakes is a primary factor driving the expansion of deep-water hypoxia in lakes during the Anthropocene. However, the interplay of regional scale environmental stressors and the lack of long-term instrumental data often impede analyses attempting to associate changes in land cover with downstream aquatic responses. Herein, we performed a synthesis of data that link paleolimnological reconstructions of lake bottom-water oxygenation to changes in land cover/use and climate over the past 300 years to evaluate whether the spread of hypoxia in European lakes was primarily associated with enhanced P exports from growing urbanization, intensified agriculture, or climatic change. We showed that hypoxia started spreading in European lakes around CE 1850 and was greatly accelerated after CE 1900. Socioeconomic changes in Europe beginning in CE 1850 resulted in widespread urbanization, as well as a larger and more intensively cultivated surface area. However, our analysis of temporal trends demonstrated that the onset and intensification of lacustrine hypoxia were more strongly related to the growth of urban areas than to changes in agricultural areas and the application of fertilizers. These results suggest that anthropogenically triggered hypoxia in European lakes was primarily caused by enhanced P discharges from urban point sources. To date, there have been no signs of sustained recovery of bottom-water oxygenation in lakes following the enactment of European water legislation in the 1970s to 1980s, and the subsequent decrease in domestic P consumption.},

              hypoxia
              , for a specific level of oxygen depletion, can be expressed as the hypoxic factor in lakes, reservoirs, and river sections. These methods summarize information of individual dissolved oxygen profiles as annual values or factors that facilitate comparison between and within lakes. Therefore, these factors are useful in the formulation and testing of hypotheses related to the dissolved oxygen status in water bodies. Methods of calculating different factors for different oxygen levels and water layers, including those applying separately to the epilimnion and hypolimnion, are presented in detail. Proven and potential applicability include: (1) the quantification of relationships with lake water quality variables and lake classification (trophic state), (2) the evaluation of restoration techniques with respect to their effects on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, (3) the determination of internal phosphorus loading in stratified and polymictic lakes, (4) the exploration of habitat constraints due to hypoxia (e.g., fish species richness and winterkill), (5) forecasting potential effects of climatic change on oxygen content and internal phosphorus loading, and (6) the establishment and examination of criteria and guidelines with respect to hypoxia by custom-made definitions.},

	abstract = {Lake warming can negatively impact cool-water fishes through both temperature and oxygen stress. We modeled the joint dynamics of water column temperature and oxygen to quantify oxythermal habitat for yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in Fish Lake, Wisconsin, USA. To estimate annual oxythermal stress, we developed a novel metric (cumulative oxythermal stress dosage; COSD) that integrates both stress duration and stress magnitude. We find that COSD better predicts observed perch declines than the published TDO3 metric (temperature at depth where dissolved oxygen is 3 mg·L
              −1
              ), which was developed for cold-water fish. Simulations show increases in COSD between 1911 and 2014, punctuated by a sharp rise since 1989. Extreme COSD years result from the intersection of high maximum daily dosage and prolonged duration exceeding the tolerance threshold. Temperature perturbation experiments to explore future climate scenarios reveal that COSD would increase greatly if the atmosphere warms by {\textgreater}3 °C. Applying the COSD metric broadly to temperate lakes could help direct management efforts toward the ecosystems most likely to serve as climate refugia for cold- and cool-water fishes in the future.},

	abstract = {Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution.
            The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive.
            The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January–June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90\% BMA prediction intervals were 66\% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7\% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8\% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed.},

	abstract = {We quantified summer internal phosphorus (P) loads and all the major P fluxes in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, a deep stratified eutrophic lake, during two summers of contrasting external loads to determine (i) whether internal loading by entrainment (mixing at the thermocline) is a significant part of the epilimnetic P budget and (ii) what factors lead to interannual variability in internal loading. We estimated variables for the P budget weekly (standing stock, sedimentation) or daily (outflow, inflow, and entrainment) during a summer of average runoff (1992) and one of higher than average runoff (1993). Entrainment, estimated by calculating the amount of P transported into the epilimnion after the thermocline deepened following storms, was about 10 times higher than external loading during 1992, but was about equal to external loading during 1993. When entrainment was included, the epilimnetic P budget balanced. Interannual variability in internal loading appears to be due to a combination of water column stability, weather, and the P levels accumulated in the metalimnion. External loads to the epilimnion during summer 1993 were much higher than in 1992 (7.0 and 0.9 mg P ·m

	abstract = {Eutrophication increases hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs, causing deleterious effects on biological communities. Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

	abstract = {Despite growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services and the economic and ecological harm caused by invasive species, linkages between invasions, changes in ecosystem functioning, and in turn, provisioning of ecosystem services remain poorly documented and poorly understood. We evaluate the economic impacts of an invasion that cascaded through a food web to cause substantial declines in water clarity, a valued ecosystem service. The predatory zooplankton, the spiny water flea (
              Bythotrephes longimanus
              ), invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1980s and has subsequently undergone secondary spread to inland lakes, including Lake Mendota (Wisconsin), in 2009. In Lake Mendota,
              Bythotrephes
              has reached unparalleled densities compared with in other lakes, decreasing biomass of the grazer
              Daphnia pulicaria
              and causing a decline in water clarity of nearly 1 m. Time series modeling revealed that the loss in water clarity, valued at US\$140 million (US\$640 per household), could be reversed by a 71\% reduction in phosphorus loading. A phosphorus reduction of this magnitude is estimated to cost between US\$86.5 million and US\$163 million (US\$430–US\$810 per household). Estimates of the economic effects of Great Lakes invasive species may increase considerably if cases of secondary invasions into inland lakes, such as Lake Mendota, are included. Furthermore, such extreme cases of economic damages call for increased investment in the prevention and control of invasive species to better maximize the economic benefits of such programs. Our results highlight the need to more fully incorporate ecosystem services into our analysis of invasive species impacts, management, and public policy.},

Although it is known that seasonal patterns in nutrient availability are key drivers of both stream metabolism and eutrophication, there has been little success in developing a comprehensive understanding of seasonal variations in nutrient export across watersheds or of the relationship between nutrient seasonality and watershed characteristics. In the present study, we have used concentration and discharge data from more than 200 stations across U.S. and Canadian watersheds to identify (1) archetypal seasonal concentration regimes for nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total phosphorus, and (2) dominant watershed controls on these regimes across a gradient of climate, land use, and topography. Our analysis shows that less impacted watersheds, with more forested and wetland area, most commonly exhibit concentration regimes that are in phase with discharge, with concentration lows occurring during summer low-ﬂow periods. Agricultural watersheds also commonly exhibit in-phase behavior, though the seasonality is usually muted compared to that seen in less impacted areas. With increasing urban area, however, nutrient concentrations frequently become essentially aseasonal or even exhibit clearly outof-phase behavior. In addition, our data indicate that seasonal SRP concentration patterns may be strongly inﬂuenced by proximal controls such as the presence of dams and reservoirs. In all, these results suggest that human activity is signiﬁcantly altering nutrient concentration regimes, with large potential consequences for both in-stream metabolism and eutrophication risk in downstream waterbodies.},

The anoxic factor (AF, days per year or per season) estimates the number of days that a sediment area equal to the lake surface area is overlain by anoxic water. It can be expressed separately as summer or winter AE Stepwise multiple-regression models were constructed with AF and common physical and chemical variables to predict fish species richness. Because some of the parametric regression assumptions were violated, the traditional statistics were evaluated with randomization tests to confirm significance. The best regression models included summer AF or lake surface area, or winter AF and mean depth, for subsets of acidic and circumneutral lakes; these models explained up to 75\% of the variation in fish species richness. One of the models can be used to estimate the likelihood of winterkill. Anoxic factor was also correlated with the number of coldwater fish species present. The concept of AF can be used to model the distribution and number of fish species in stratified lakes and should be useful in the management of oxygen-dependent aquatic animals (e.g., finfish and shrimp) in freshwater and marine habitats.},

Anoxia can be expressed and quantified as the anoxic factor; hypoxia, for a specific level of oxygen depletion, can be expressed as the hypoxic factor in lakes, reservoirs, and river sections. These methods summarize information of individual dissolved oxygen profiles as annual values or factors that facilitate comparison between and within lakes. Therefore, these factors are useful in the formulation and testing of hypotheses related to the dissolved oxygen status in water bodies. Methods of calculating different factors for different oxygen levels and water layers, including those applying separately to the epilimnion and hypolimnion, are presented in detail. Proven and potential applicability include: (1) the quantification of relationships with lake water quality variables and lake classification (trophic state), (2) the evaluation of restoration techniques with respect to their effects on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, (3) the determination of internal phosphorus loading in stratified and polymictic lakes, (4) the exploration of habitat constraints due to hypoxia (e.g., fish species richness and winterkill), (5) forecasting potential effects of climatic change on oxygen content and internal phosphorus loading, and (6) the establishment and examination of criteria and guidelines with respect to hypoxia by custom-made definitions.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the reductions in P loading needed to control blue-green algal blooms in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. After developing a 21-year loading data set, we used a P mass balance model expressed as a difference equation with an annual time step indexed from mid-April. We defined and estimated a loss parameter λ as the proportion of the lake’s April P concentration lost through sedimentation and outflow during the following year. Using the distribution of annual λ’s and input loadings, we predicted the steady-state distribution of April P concentrations that would result from scenarios of altered inputs due to changes in management practices. These results were then linked to the probability of summer blue-green algal blooms. For no load reduction, the probability of a bloom ({\textgreater}2 mg algaeиL–1) on any summer day is about 60\%. This probability decreases to 20\% with a load reduction of 50\%. Our approach illustrates how managers can consider reducing the frequency of extreme events like algal blooms, which may correspond more to the public’s perception of lake water quality than average conditions.},

An alternative is using models, which summarise the knowledge of the functioning of the system so that they can be used to answer specific questions. We present a model to calculate the epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature of inland water bodies based on air temperature and on their geographical and morphological characteristics. The seven model parameters were parameterized by using official monitoring data and the satellite temperature data of the data set LakeSST for French water bodies. The performance of the parameterised model was compared to that of two widely used models (FLake and air2water with four parameters). The model showed a good performance in the simulation of epilimnion temperatures, especially in the summer. For hypolimnion temperatures the performance was worse, but still comparable to that of other models. Because of its good performance and the few data needed to run the model, it is a good choice for managers interested in the thermal behaviour of inland water bodies.},

	abstract = {Volcanic lakes are characterized by physicochemical favorable conditions for the development of reservoirs of C-bearing greenhouse gases that can be dispersed to air during occasional rollover events. By combining a microbiological and geochemical approach, we showed that the chemistry of the CO2- and CH4-rich gas reservoir hosted within the meromictic Lake Averno (Campi Flegrei, southern Italy) are related to the microbial niche differentiation along the vertical water column. The simultaneous occurrence of diverse functional groups of microbes operating under different conditions suggests that these habitats harbor complex microbial consortia that impact on the production and consumption of greenhouse gases. In the epilimnion, the activity of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic biota, together with CO2 dissolution at relatively high pH, enhanced CO2- and CH4 consumption, which also occurred in the hypolimnion. Moreover, results from computations carried out to evaluate the dependence of the lake stability on the CO2/CH4 ratios, suggested that the water density vertical gradient was mainly controlled by salinity and temperature, whereas the effect of dissolved gases was minor, excepting if extremely high increases of CH4 are admitted. Therefore, biological processes, controlling the composition of CO2 and CH4, contributed to stabilize the lake stratification of the lake. Overall, Lake Averno, and supposedly the numerous worldwide distributed volcanic lakes having similar features (namely bio-activity lakes), acts as a sink for the CO2 supplied from the hydrothermal/magmatic system, displaying a significant influence on the local carbon budget.},

This accuracy for the lake storage could not be achieved by other methods, especially if conditions were difficult, e.g. snowfall, or in cases when precipitation was small. Finally, the pressure measurement – originally intended to roughly determine the water level – turned out to be a direct measurement of water mass in the lake, which was the proper magnitude for exchanges between atmosphere and lake. Hence the measurement of lake storage could become an interesting approach even for meteorological measurements, such as precipitation and evaporation on a water surface.},

Secondly, we investigated the effects of temperature stratification on substance mass transport using the three-dimensional model. The advective and dispersive transport for a tracer released in a river and in a side arm of the reservoir were quantified. We identified that considering the effects of temperature stratification increased the horizontal advective transport - up to a maximum of 40\% increase for the tracer released in the river, and 9\% for the side arm. In relation to dispersive transport there was a decrease in transport due to temperature stratification, and no pattern was discernible for the side arm tracer modeling.Keywords:  Reservoirs; Heat transport model; One-dimensional; Three-dimensional},

In view of the anticipated oxygen loss in aquatic systems due to eutrophication and climate change, HYPOX was set up to improve capacities to monitor hypoxia as well as to understand its causes and consequences. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater} Temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of hypoxia were analyzed in field studies in various aquatic environments, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Scottish and Scandinavian fjords, Ionian Sea lagoons and embayments, and Swiss lakes. Examples of episodic and rapid (hours) occurrences of hypoxia, as well as seasonal changes in bottom-water oxygenation in stratified systems, are discussed. Geologically driven hypoxia caused by gas seepage is demonstrated. Using novel technologies, temporal and spatial patterns of water-column oxygenation, from basin-scale seasonal patterns to meter-scale sub-micromolar oxygen distributions, were resolved. Existing multidecadal monitoring data were used to demonstrate the imprint of climate change and eutrophication on long-term oxygen distributions. Organic and inorganic proxies were used to extend investigations on past oxygen conditions to centennial and even longer timescales that cannot be resolved by monitoring. The effects of hypoxia on faunal communities and biogeochemical processes were also addressed in the project. An investigation of benthic fauna is presented as an example of hypoxia-devastated benthic communities that slowly recover upon a reduction in eutrophication in a system where naturally occurring hypoxia overlaps with anthropogenic hypoxia. Biogeochemical investigations reveal that oxygen intrusions have a strong effect on the microbially mediated redox cycling of elements. Observations and modeling studies of the sediments demonstrate the effect of seasonally changing oxygen conditions on benthic mineralization pathways and fluxes. Data quality and access are crucial in hypoxia research. Technical issues are therefore also addressed, including the availability of suitable sensor technology to resolve the gradual changes in bottom-water oxygen in marine systems that can be expected as a result of climate change. Using cabled observatories as examples, we show how the benefit of continuous oxygen monitoring can be maximized by adopting proper quality control. Finally, we discuss strategies for state-of-the-art data archiving and dissemination in compliance with global standards, and how ocean observations can contribute to global earth observation attempts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The (Lower) Lake of Zurich provides an ideal system for studying the long-term impact of environmental change on deep-water hypoxia because of its sensitivity to climatic forcing, its history of eutrophication and subsequent oligotrophication, and the quality and length of its data set. Based on 39 years (1972–2010) of measured profiles of temperature, oxygen concentration and phosphorus (P) concentration, the potentially confounding effects of oligotrophication and climatic forcing on the occurrence and extent of deep-water hypoxia in the lake were investigated. The time-series of Nürnberg's hypoxic factor (HF) for the lake can be divided into three distinct segments: (i) a segment of consistently low HF from 1972 to the late-1980s climate regime shift (CRS); (ii) a transitional segment between the late-1980s CRS and approximately 2000 within which the HF was highly variable; and (iii) a segment of consistently high HF thereafter. The increase in hypoxia during the study period was not a consequence of a change in trophic status, as the lake underwent oligotrophication as a result of reduced external P loading during this time. Instead, wavelet analysis suggests that changes in the lake's mixing regime, initiated by the late-1980s CRS, ultimately led to a delayed but abrupt decrease in the deep-water oxygen concentration, resulting in a general expansion of the hypoxic zone in autumn. Even after detrending to remove long-term effects, the concentration of soluble reactive P in the bottom water of the lake was highly correlated with various measures of hypoxia, providing quantitative evidence supporting the probable effect of hypoxia on internal P loading. Such climate-induced, ecosystem-scale changes, which may result in undesirable effects such as a decline in water quality and a reduction in coldwater fish habitats, provide further evidence for the vulnerability of large temperate lakes to predicted increases in global air temperature.},

The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

Adding a linear factor for water depth further improved the model indicating that oxygen depletion increased substantially along the depth. Two other factors turned out to significantly influence ODR: total phosphorus as a proxy for the lake’s trophic state and mean oxygen concentration in the respective depth layer.

Absorption of solar radiation by the dystrophic waters, effective shelter from wind-induced turbulence, and considerable relative depths all combine to prevent mixing of heat much below the surface 2 m of most study lakes. Birgean wind-work values therefore remain low, and cold hypolimnetic waters occupy much of the lake volume. The lakes also respond quickly to meteorological change, which causes considerable year-to-year variation, and some short-term fluctuation, in their heat budgets and maximum stabilities.

	abstract = {By contrast to the more regular and predictable temperate lakes, heat budgets and temperature dynamics in Mediterranean reservoirs are characterized by a marked interannual variability. In the present paper, the heat content, annual Birgean heat budget (ABHB), and thermal structure of Sau Reservoir were examined during a period of hypolimnetic withdrawal between 1980 and 1985, and during a period of withdrawal at intermediate depths between 1996 and 2003. The two study periods were also characterized by a wide range of stored water volume fluctuations. Results were used to develop and validate an empirical model to predict annual and monthly heat dynamics statistics and mixed layer depth as a function of hydraulic management parameters such as water volume and selective withdrawal depth. During the hypolimnetic withdrawal period elevated ABHB and deep mixed layer depths were recorded in the reservoir, which behaved as a heat trap. By contrast, intermediate depth withdrawal promoted a shallower and more stable thermocline, thus increasing the cold hypolimnetic water volume and decreasing heat content and ABHB. The study reveals that hydraulic management constitutes the main driver of the heat and thermal dynamics in reservoirs with multiple withdrawal outlets. By contrast with the increasing temperature trends recorded in many natural lakes, the hydraulic management in Sau Reservoir induced a progressive reduction in water temperature and heat content in the system, thus partially counteracting the possible deleterious effects of global warming. Our intensive study in a single, highly-dynamic ecosystem constitutes a new approximation to the study of thermal structure and heat dynamics in water bodies. (© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

These factors allowed only surface waters to contribute to the annual heat exchange cycle, thereby reducing the magnitude of each lake's heat budgets and influencing stability and wind work values. The lakes show considerable short- and long-term fluctuations in heat content, stability and wind work values in response to the capricious maritime meteorological conditions of the area. However, long periods between successive samplings may have caused some underestimation of the ranges of these three parameters.

After the cold winter 2008–2009, a heat wave starting in May turned the whole year 2009 the second hottest after 2003. The particular sequence of meteorological events resulted in extreme vertical temperature gradients and unusually high thermal stability of both lakes. All calculated thermal parameters showed the highest values in 2009 while also the values for 2008 exceeded considerably those published for these lakes in the past. Due to the large wind exposed surface, wind mixing was supposedly the dominating mechanism of heat transfer in the shallower eutrophic Lake Varese where, due to low water transparency, large amount of solar energy trapped in the upper layers markedly increased the thermal stability. In the deeper and more transparent Lake Monate, the deeper penetrating solar irradiance contributed to better energy dissipation within the water column and smaller interannual differences in thermal stability.},

GLM was developed to support the science needs of the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), a network of researchers using sensors to understand lake functioning and address questions about how lakes around the world respond to climate and land use change. The scale and diversity of lake types, locations, and sizes, and the expanding observational datasets created the need for a robust community model of lake dynamics with sufficient flexibility to accommodate a range of scientific and management questions relevant to the GLEON community. This paper summarizes the scientific basis and numerical implementation of the model algorithms, including details of sub-models that simulate surface heat exchange and ice cover dynamics, vertical mixing, and inflow–outflow dynamics. We demonstrate the suitability of the model for different lake types that vary substantially in their morphology, hydrology, and climatic conditions. GLM supports a dynamic coupling with biogeochemical and ecological modelling libraries for integrated simulations of water quality and ecosystem health, and options for integration with other environmental models are outlined. Finally, we discuss utilities for the analysis of model outputs and uncertainty assessments, model operation within a distributed cloud-computing environment, and as a tool to support the learning of network participants.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Despite growing evidence that climate change will increase temperature variability and the frequency of temperature extremes, many modeling studies that analyze the effects of warming scenarios on cyanobacteria in lakes examine uniform warming temperature scenarios without including any variability. Here, we used the one-dimensional hydrodynamic General Lake Model coupled to Aquatic EcoDynamics modules (GLM-AED) to simulate 11 years of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial biomass in Lake Mendota (Madison, WI, USA). We developed climate scenarios with either uniform (constant) warming or variable warming based on random sampling of daily air temperatures from either a normal or Poisson probability distribution. We found that while the median cyanobacterial biomass among repeated simulations for each of the years was similar regardless of whether or not air temperature variability was included in the climate scenarios, the randomly-sampled air temperature distribution scenarios exhibited much greater variability in the year-to-year cyanobacterial biomass estimates. Our results suggest that including temperature variability in climate scenarios may substantially change our understanding of how climate warming may alter cyanobacterial blooms over yearly to decadal time scales. To more effectively predict the range of possible future cyanobacterial dynamics, both the magnitude and variability of warming must be considered when developing climate scenarios for lake modeling studies.},

	abstract = {Many lakes show vertical stratification of their water masses, at least for some extended time periods. Density differences in water bodies facilitate an evolution of chemical differences with many consequences for living organisms in lakes. Temperature and dissolved substances contribute to density differences in water. The atmosphere imposes a temperature signal on the lake surface. As a result, thermal stratification can be established during the warm season if a lake is sufficiently deep. On the contrary, during the cold period, surface cooling forces vertical circulation of water masses and removal of gradients of water properties. However, gradients of dissolved substances may be sustained for periods much longer than one annual cycle. Such lakes do not experience full overturns. Gradients may be a consequence of external inflows or groundwater seepage. In addition, photosynthesis at the lake surface and subsequent decomposition of organic material in the deeper layers of a lake can sustain a gradient of dissolved substances. Three more geochemical cycles, namely, calcite precipitation, iron cycle, and manganese cycle, are known for sustaining meromixis. A limited number of lakes do not experience a complete overturn because of pressure dependence of temperature of maximum density. Such lakes must be sufficiently deep and lie in the appropriate climate zone. Although these lakes are permanently stratified, deep waters are well ventilated, and chemical differences are small. Turbulent mixing and convective deep water renewal must be very effective. As a consequence, these lakes usually are not termed meromictic. Permanent stratification may also be created by episodic partial recharging of the deep water layer. This mechanism resembles the cycling of the ocean: horizontal gradients result from gradients at the surface, such as differential cooling or enhanced evaporation in adjacent shallow side bays. Dense water parcels can be formed which intrude the deep water layer. In the final section, stratification relevant physical properties, such as sound speed, hydrostatic pressure, electrical conductivity, and density, are discussed. The assumptions behind salinity, electrical conductance, potential density, and potential temperature are introduced. Finally, empirical and theoretical approaches for quantitative evaluation from easy to measure properties conclude this contribution.},

For example, it may be possible to identify metabolically similar species as groups of organisms that correlate spatially with the geochemical processes they carry out. Here, we use a 16S ribosomal RNA gene survey in a lake that has chemical gradients across its depth to identify groups of spatially correlated but phylogenetically diverse organisms. Some groups had distributions across depth that aligned with the distributions of metabolic processes predicted by a biogeochemical model, suggesting that these groups performed biogeochemical functions. A single-cell genetic assay showed, however, that the groups associated with one biogeochemical process, sulfate reduction, contained only a few organisms that have the genes required to reduce sulfate. These results raise the possibility that some of these spatially correlated groups are consortia of phylogenetically diverse and metabolically different microbes that cooperate to carry out geochemical functions.},

	abstract = {Global urbanization trends impose major alterations on surface waters. This includes impacts on ecosystem functioning that can involve feedbacks on climate through changes in rates of greenhouse gas emissions. The combination of high nutrient supply and shallow depth typical of urban freshwaters is particularly conducive to high rates of methane (CH4) production and emission, suggesting a potentially important role in the global CH4 cycle. However, there is a lack of comprehensive flux data from diverse urban water bodies, of information on the underlying drivers, and of estimates for whole cities. Based on measurements over four seasons in a total of 32 water bodies in the city of Berlin, Germany, we calculate the total CH4 emission from various types of surface waters of a large city in temperate climate at 2.6 ± 1.7 Gg CH4 yr-1.The average total emission was 219 ± 490 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. Water-chemical variables were surprisingly poor predictors of total CH4 emissions, and proxies of productivity and oxygen conditions had low explanatory power as well, suggesting a complex combination of factors governing CH4 fluxes from urban surface waters. However, small water bodies (area {\textless}1 ha) typically located in urban green spaces were identified as emission hotspots. These results help constrain assessments of CH4 emissions from freshwaters in the world's growing cities, facilitating extrapolation of urban emissions to large areas, including at the global scale.

	abstract = {Shallow fluvial lakes are dynamic ecosystems shaped by physical and biological factors and characterized by the coexistence of phytoplankton and macrophytes. Due to multiple interplaying factors, understanding the distribution of phytoplankton in fluvial lakes is a complex but fundamental issue, in the context of increasing eutrophication, climate change, and multiple water uses. We analyze the distribution of phytoplankton by combining remotely sensed maps of chlorophyll-a with a hydrodynamic model in a dammed fluvial lake (Mantua Superior Lake, Northern Italy). The numerical simulation of different conditions shows that the main hydrodynamic effects which influence algal distribution are related to the combined effect of advection due to wind forces and local currents, as well as to the presence of large gyres which induce recirculation and stagnation regions, favoring phytoplankton accumulation. Therefore, the general characters of the phytoplankton horizontal patchiness can be inferred from the results of the hydrodynamic model. Conversely, hyperspectral remote-sensing products can be used to validate this model, as they provide chlorophyll-a distribution maps. The integration of ecological, hydraulic, and remote-sensing techniques may therefore help the monitoring and protection of inland water quality, with important improvements in management actions by policy makers.},

Urban stormwater runoff, which degrades streams through altered volume, pattern and quality of flow, presents a problem that challenges dominant approaches to stormwater and water resource management, and to environmental flow assessment. We used evidence of ecological response to different stormwater drainage systems to develop methods for input to environmental flow assessment. We identified the nature of hydrologic change resulting from conventional urban stormwater runoff, and the mechanisms by which such hydrologic change is prevented in streams where ecological condition has been protected. We also quantified the increase in total volume resulting from urban stormwater runoff, by comparing annual streamflow volumes from undeveloped catchments with the volumes that would run off impervious surfaces under the same rainfall regimes. In catchments with as little as 5–10\% total imperviousness, conventional stormwater drainage, associated with poor in-stream ecological condition, reduces contributions to baseflows and increases the frequency and magnitude of storm flows, but in similarly impervious catchments in which streams retain good ecological condition, informal drainage to forested hillslopes, without a direct piped discharge to the stream, results in little such hydrologic change. In urbanized catchments, dispersed urban stormwater retention measures can potentially protect urban stream ecosystems by mimicking the hydrologic effects of informal drainage, if sufficient water is harvested and kept out of the stream, and if discharged water is treated to a suitable quality. Urban stormwater is a new class of environmental flow problem: one that requires reduction of a large excess volume of water to maintain riverine ecological integrity. It is the best type of problem, because solving it provides an opportunity to solve other problems such as the provision of water for human use.},

From this time to the present, extensive limnological data on the lake's water quality have been collected which have been used to validate a one-dimensional water quality model. Three cases are discussed: full operation of a network of 15 aerators, intermittent operation as water quality improved and no aeration as is the present situation. The effect of the hypolimnetic aerator was modelled once as a stirrer and also as a bubbler. While both are designed to impart mechanical energy to the water column to promote mixing by means of a column of bubbles, stirrers are meant to restrict the mixing between the epilimnion and hypolimnion by collecting the bubble streams before they penetrate the upper layer. On the other hand, for bubblers the bubble column continues unimpeded to the surface. We conclude that the design of the hypolimnetic aerators employed in Lake Tegel behave more closely to a bubble plume and thus there is considerable mixing between the hypolimnion and epilimnion.},

	abstract = {ADCP and temperature chain measurements have been used to estimate the rate of energy input by wind stress to the water surface in the south basin of Windermere. The energy input from the atmosphere was found to increase markedly as the lake stratified in spring. The efficiency of energy transfer (Eff), defined as the ratio of the rate of working in near-surface waters (RW) to that above the lake surface (P 10), increased from ∼0.0013 in vertically homogenous conditions to ∼0.0064 in the first 40 days of the stratified regime. A maximum value of Eff∼0.01 was observed when, with increasing stratification, the first mode internal seiche period decreased to match the diurnal wind period of 24 h. The increase in energy input, following the onset of stratification was reflected in enhancement of the mean depth-varying kinetic energy without a corresponding increase in wind forcing. Parallel estimates of energy dissipation in the bottom boundary layer, based on determination of the structure function show that it accounts for ∼15\% of RW in stratified conditions. The evolution of stratification in the lake conforms to a heating stirring model which indicates that mixing accounts for ∼21\% of RW. Taken together, these estimates of key energetic parameters point the way to the development of full energy budgets for lakes and shallow seas.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather can have a substantial influence on lakes and is expected to become more frequent with climate change. We explored the influence of one particular extreme event, Storm Ophelia, on the physical and chemical environment of England’s largest lake, Windermere. We found that the substantial influence of Ophelia on meteorological conditions at Windermere, in particular wind speed, resulted in a 25-fold increase (relative to the study-period average) in the wind energy flux at the lake-air interface. Following Ophelia, there was a short-lived mixing event in which the Schmidt stability decreased by over 100 Jm−2 and the thermocline deepened by over 10 m during a 12-h period. As a result of changes to the strength of stratification, Ophelia also changed the internal seiche regime of Windermere with the dominant seiche period increasing from {\textasciitilde} 17 h pre-storm to {\textasciitilde} 21 h post-storm. Following Ophelia, there was an upwelling of cold and low-oxygenated waters at the southern-end of the lake. This had a substantial influence on the main outflow of Windermere, the River Leven, where dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased by {\textasciitilde} 48\%, from 9.3 to 4.8 mg L−1, while at the mid-lake monitoring station in Windermere, it decreased by only {\textasciitilde} 3\%. This study illustrates that the response of a lake to extreme weather can cause important effects downstream, the influence of which may not be evident at the lake surface. To understand the impact of future extreme events fully, the whole lake and downstream-river system need to be studied together.},

In catchments with as little as 5–10\% total imperviousness, conventional stormwater drainage, associated with poor in-stream ecological condition, reduces contributions to baseflows and increases the frequency and magnitude of storm flows, but in similarly impervious catchments in which streams retain good ecological condition, informal drainage to forested hillslopes, without a direct piped discharge to the stream, results in little such hydrologic change. In urbanized catchments, dispersed urban stormwater retention measures can potentially protect urban stream ecosystems by mimicking the hydrologic effects of informal drainage, if sufficient water is harvested and kept out of the stream, and if discharged water is treated to a suitable quality. Urban stormwater is a new class of environmental flow problem: one that requires reduction of a large excess volume of water to maintain riverine ecological integrity. It is the best type of problem, because solving it provides an opportunity to solve other problems such as the provision of water for human use.},

	abstract = {Concepts of age, residence time, transit time, and turn-over time are summarized which are useful for describing the exchange and transport of water or materials in a coastal sea. The age of a particle is defined as a time which has elapsed since it entered the reservoir, and the residence time is defined as a time which will be taken for a particle to reach the outlet. Time scales based on the age are simply related with those based on the residence time. It is shown that a suitable time scale for representing the exchange characteristics is the average residence time and not the turnover time, which has often been used as the exchange time scale. Further, the ‘remnant function’ which describes the phenomena of exchange or transport is introduced, and is related to the residence time. Exchange and transport time scales in a coastal sea are discussed on the basis of the residence time which can be applied to not only steady-state cases, but also the cases where material is injected instantaneously. The average residence time in a one-dimensional channel and bay is obtained from the solutions of the advection-diffusion equation. If we know a flow speed and diffusion coefficient in a channel or bay regarded as one-dimensional, we can translate them into the average residence time. As an example, the average residence time of the Seto Inland Sea is discussed.},

	abstract = {In the context of aquatic biogeochemical modelling, there is an increasing pressure to explicitly treat multiple biogeochemical cycles and to increase the functional diversity of biotic communities. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of 124 aquatic biogeochemical models to reproduce the dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups. Our analysis reinforces earlier findings that aquatic ecosystem modellers do not seem to consistently apply conventional methodological steps during the development of their models. Although there is an improvement relative to earlier critiques, significant portion of published studies did not properly assess model sensitivity to input vectors; aquatic ecosystem modellers are still reluctant to embrace optimization techniques during model calibration; and assess the ability of their models to support predictions in the extrapolation domain. We also found significant variability with respect to the mathematical representation of key physiological processes (e.g., growth strategies, nutrient kinetics, settling velocities) as well as group-specific characterizations typically considered in the pertinent literature. Cyanobacteria blooms are a major concern for water industries as they represent high risk for human health and economic costs for drinking water treatment, and thus one of the outstanding challenges is to offer credible modelling tools that can serve as early warning systems to assist with the operational control of cyanobacteria blooms. Our study suggests that the derivation of distinct functional groups from fairly heterogeneous planktonic assemblages poses challenging problems. Because of the still poorly understood ecology, we do not have robust group-specific parameterizations that can support predictions in a wide array of spatiotemporal domains. In this context, we argue that the most prudent strategies are the gradual incorporation of complexity, where possible and relevant, along with an open dialogue on how we can mathematically depict the interconnections among different phytoplankton subunits or even how we can frame the suitable data collection efforts.},

	abstract = {Lake Tegel (Berlin, Germany) is controlled by two main inflows: inflow \#1 (River Havel) is heavily phosphorus-laden, whereas inflow \#2 is an artificial confluence that includes discharge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant distinguished by high levels of phosphorus and pharmaceuticals. To reduce the phosphorus load on the lake, a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP) is situated at inflow \#2. Moreover, the two inflows are short-circuited by a pipeline that transfers part of the inflow \#1 water to the PEP and finally releases it into inflow \#2. The pipeline and the PEP have contributed to a continuous reduction in the total phosphorus concentration of Lake Tegel in the past 25 years. We investigate the question of whether the existing lake pipeline can also be used to reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals in Lake Tegel originating from inflow \#2 by dilution with water from River Havel, by diverting part of inflow \#2 around the lake, or by a combination of both strategies. The circulation pattern of Lake Tegel is complicated by complex bathymetry and numerous islands and is therefore highly sensitive to winds. We tested seven different management scenarios by hydrodynamic modeling for a period of 16 years with the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). None of the scenarios provided a strategy optimal for both pharmaceuticals and phosphorus. Nonetheless, compound regimes, such as alternating the pipe flow direction or adding another pipeline, allowed the most abundant pharmaceutical (carbamazepine) to be reduced while maintaining the current phosphorus level. This study demonstrates the ability of immediate lake regulation measures to maintain water quality. In the case of Lake Tegel, the pipeline can be fully effective with regard to pharmaceuticals only in combination with additional efforts such as advanced pharmaceutical treatment of wastewater and/or phosphorus reduction in the River Havel catchment.},

Because the contributions of each inflow have not yet been quantified and because the lake features complex bathymetry and numerous islands, a hydrodynamic circulation model with high spatial resolution and dynamic wind forcing is useful. We applied the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model to separate the influences of wind and river discharge on the currents and mass transport in Lake Tegel. For model validation, we compared the simulation results with 1 year of electrical conductivity data, which was used as a conservative tracer to distinguish between water from the River Havel and water supplied by a smaller second inflow. Calculation of currents alone is insufficient to investigate water exchanges between rivers and lakes, especially when several islands create multiple pathways for river intrusion. Therefore, mass transport simulations are applied. Our calculations based on archetypical scenarios indicate that the proportion of (polluted) water from the River Havel in the main basin of Lake Tegel fluctuates with river discharge and wind, which either amplify or neutralize each other.},

	abstract = {Climate change is rapidly warming aquatic ecosystems including lakes and reservoirs. However, variability in lake characteristics can modulate how lakes respond to climate. Water clarity is especially important both because it influences the depth range over which heat is absorbed, and because it is changing in many lakes. Here, we show that simulated long-term water clarity trends influence how both surface and bottom water temperatures of lakes and reservoirs respond to climate change. Clarity changes can either amplify or suppress climate-induced warming, depending on lake depth and the direction of clarity change. Using a process-based model to simulate 1894 north temperate lakes from 1979 to 2012, we show that a scenario of decreasing clarity at a conservative yet widely observed rate of 0.92\% yr−1 warmed surface waters and cooled bottom waters at rates comparable in magnitude to climate-induced warming. For lakes deeper than 6.5 m, decreasing clarity was sufficient to fully offset the effects of climate-induced warming on median whole-lake mean temperatures. Conversely, a scenario increasing clarity at the same rate cooled surface waters and warmed bottom waters relative to baseline warming rates. Furthermore, in 43\% of lakes, increasing clarity more than doubled baseline bottom temperature warming rates. Long-term empirical observations of water temperature in lakes with and without clarity trends support these simulation results. Together, these results demonstrate that water clarity trends may be as important as rising air temperatures in determining how waterbodies respond to climate change.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in water quality modeling is adequately representing the changing state of aquatic ecosystems as accurately as possible, but with appropriate mathematical relationships without creating a highly complex and overly parameterized model. A model more complex than necessary will require more input and results in unaffordable calibration times. In this work we propose and test a calibration strategy for a one-dimensional dynamic physical–ecological model (DYRESM–CAEDYM) to reproduce the seasonal changes in the functional composition of the phytoplankton community existing in El Gergal reservoir (Seville, Spain). The community is described as a succession of functional groups with different response to environmental conditions. First, we performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters to include in the calibration process, and then applied a global optimization algorithm to fit the model for each algal group in a sequential fashion. Finally we simulated all the functional groups adopting parameter values established during the group-by-group calibrations. Our results show that the performance of this approach is strictly related with: (1) the level of system description (i.e. the model structure and the number of functional groups simulated); (2) the level of information included in the calibration process (i.e. the observations); and (3) the non-linear interactions among functional groups. Functional segmentation of the model should be minimized even though groups with different environmental requirements must be discriminated. Although magnitudes of biomass peaks were not always estimated correctly, the calibrated model was able to predict peak sequence and timing of dominant phytoplankton groups. Thus our study showed that: (1) model structure and nature of observations adopted have to be in agreement with the level of organization in the system; (2) integration of automatic calibration strategies is a useful approach in complex deterministic ecological models.},

We identify a number of shortcomings related to these studies and conduct an extensive simulation study where we compare a larger number of rules available and develop some new methods. In total we compare 20 stopping rules and propose a two-step approach that appears to be highly effective. First, a Bartlett's test is used to test the significance of the first principal component, indicating whether or not at least two variables share common variation in the entire data set. If significant, a number of different rules can be applied to estimate the number of non-trivial components to be retained. However, the relative merits of these methods depend on whether data contain strongly correlated or uncorrelated variables. We also estimate the number of non-trivial components for a number of field data sets so that we can evaluate the applicability of our conclusions based on simulated data.},

An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with expected future conditions. If a scientifically guided management plan to mitigate these impacts is not implemented, we can therefore expect this bloom to be a harbinger of future blooms in Lake Erie.},

Besides the harmful algae blooms (HAB) and a severe prolonged drought, the bay has a strategic importance—e.g., the eastern channel of the newly built water diversion will withdraw water from it (drinking water). This article presents the implementation of a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model—pioneering for the region—using TELEMAC-3D. The aim was to investigate the 3D flows induced by moderate or extreme winds as well as by heating of the water surface. The findings showed that a windstorm increased the flow velocities (at least one order of magnitude, i.e., up to 10−1–10−2 m/s) without altering significantly the circulation patterns; this occurred substantially for the heating scenario, which had, in contrast, a lower effect on velocities. In terms of the bay’s management, the main implications are: (1) the withdrawals for drinking water and irrigation agriculture should stop working during windstorms and at least three days afterwards; (2) a heating of the water surface would likely increase the risk of development of HAB in the shallow areas, so that further assessments with a water quality module are needed to support advanced remediation measures; (3) the 3D model proves to be a necessary tool to identify high risk contamination areas e.g., for installation of new aquaculture systems.},

Prescribed values of tidal harmonics were used to force the model at the two open boundaries of the model domain. The numerical experiments performed consisted of the instantaneous injection, of a passive hypothetical tracer at 100\% concentration, to the whole coastal lagoon which was subject to the wind action and tidal forcing. The results indicate that influence time fluctuated between a few days and 4.0 months. The longest values were predicted close to the Talchichitle Island in the eastern part of the lagoon while the shortest were found close to the inlets where the relatively deep channels and high speed tidal currents favor the discharge of the tracer into the ocean. Knowledge of the influence time distribution is very useful to assess the environmental impacts of contaminants and to establish management plans for coastal lagoons conservation.},

We studied Lake Tegel in Berlin, Germany as a representative urban lake profoundly influenced by intense water management measures and a resulting complex hydrodynamic situation: Lake Tegel is fed by nutrient-rich river discharges and effluents from a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP). We estimated changes in water temperatures, the Wedderburn number, and the buoyancy frequency, as well as concentrations of dissolved oxygen and phosphate under climate change using a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model coupled to a water quality model. Further, we investigated how four management scenarios with varying discharges of the PEP could affect the lake system. In all simulations, water temperatures increased and summer stratification extended. The modeling results demonstrated that the water management system buffers the high nutrient supply from the river inflow and can effectively mitigate negative effects of climate change on Lake Tegel, thus highlighting its importance for the lake ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Urban surface waters face several stressors associated with industry and urban water management. Over much of the past century, the wastewater treatment in Berlin, Germany, relied on inefficient sewage farms, which resulted in severe eutrophication and sediment contamination in the recipient surface waterbodies. A prominent example is Lake Tegel, where a multitude of management measures were applied in the last decades for the purpose of ecosystem restoration. In this study, we analyzed sediment cores of three lakes with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy: Lake Tegel, Lake Großer Wannsee, which is environmentally similar but has a different management history, and Lake Userin, which serves as a reference located in a nature protection area. Multivariate statistical methods (principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and self-organizing maps) were used to assess the sediment quality and to reconstruct the management history of Lake Tegel. Principal component analysis established two main gradients of sediment composition: heavy metals and lithogenic elements. The impact of the management measures was visualized in the lake sediment composition changing from high abundance of heavy metals and reducing redox conditions to less-impacted sediments in recent layers. The clustering techniques suggested heterogeneity among sites within Lake Tegel that probably reflect urban water management measures. The abundance of heavy metals in recent lake sediments of Lake Tegel is similar to a lake with low urban impact and is lower than in Lake Großer Wannsee suggesting that the management measures were successful in the reduction of heavy metals, which are still a threat for surface waters worldwide.},

	abstract = {Thousands of lakes in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a continuous increase in water temperature and colour. While increasing temperature is an effect of climate change, several factors are suggested to drive the increasing water colour, including climate change, altered land use and reversed acidification. In this mesocosm study, we study the effects on pelagic production and sedimentation of organic carbon from a 3 °C increase in temperature, a doubling of water colour and a combination of increased temperature and water colour. These manipulations correspond to the predicted development in water colour and temperature in northern temperate systems within the life time of the next generation. The water and plankton communities in the mesocosms were taken from an oligohumic and mesotrophic lake, and the increase in water colour was achieved by the additions of water from a humic lake. The experiment ran from early March to late October. In accordance with our predictions and previous cross-system analyses, net carbon production (NCP) and organic carbon sedimentation decreased in response to increasing water colour. At odds with current theory, NCP and sedimentation increased in heated treatments, as not only respiration but also gross production increased in response to temperature. There were no synergistic effects between warming and browning. These results imply that warming may enhance pelagic delivery of organic carbon to sediments. This could potentially offset a reduction in burial efficiency of organic carbon, which has been projected based on a positive relationship between carbon mineralisation in sediments and temperature.},

	abstract = {In multidimensional water quality modelling the spatial and temporal distributions of dissolved substances and suspended particles are simulated in order to account for inhomogeneities in the transport and reactive processes. The exchange processes at the water surface, e.g. photosynthesis and oxygen transfer, and at the water–sediment interface, e.g. erosion, deposition and oxygen transfer, are basically multidimensional. A homogeneous distribution can be expected only if the mixing processes generated by the hydrodynamics occur in a short time period compared with the reaction rates. This article presents sample results of a three-dimensional water quality model that includes the lake hydrodynamics, sedimentation and the proper representation of physical and reactive processes at the bottom and surface boundaries. The goal is to use this insight in order to obtain a better description of water quality with lower-dimensional models using spatial averaging techniques. For this purpose, the program ℡EMAC-3D, which is able to calculate three-dimensional free surface flows and transport, was extended to include reactive processes. Ordinary differential equations remain to be solved following the solution of the non-reactive transport equations using operator-splitting techniques. These are in turn solved using a fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. As the reaction rates are in part considerably long compared with the hydrodynamics, a larger time-step is used for solving the transport equations. The model was applied to a lake in Berlin, Germany, the Großer Müggelsee. Although comparatively shallow, it experiences extensive multidimensional hydrodynamics as a result of wind-induced currents and the Spree River, which flows through it. Numerous water quality measurements undertaken by the Institüt für Gewässerökologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB) demonstrate the influence of the hydrodynamics on the concentration distributions. A comparison between calculations with the spatial average of the 3-D model and directly calculated 0-D model results using the same reactive–kinetic formulations clearly demonstrates that the multidimensional effects, including the current distribution, have a significant effect on the water quality. Therefore, care must be taken to correctly include multidimensional effects for detailed assessment of possible remedial measures to improve the water quality. An averaging technique for including these effects is presented. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {PurposeIn lake restoration, the redox sensitivity of iron (Fe)–phosphorus (P) compounds has been regarded as detrimental for a sustainable increase in sedimentary P retention since developing low redox potentials release Fe-bound P. Thus, Fe salts alone have rarely been used successfully to inactivate sediment P, and there are no studies on the long-term effects of in-lake Fe applications on P retention. Here, we analyzed for how long, and how efficiently, a single and continuous Fe application can affect the P budget of lakes.Materials and methodsTwo aerated lakes in Berlin, Germany were compared: Lake Tegel (TEG) experienced a continuous Fe supply via its tributaries, while Lake Groß-Glienicke (GGS) was treated once with Fe in the winter of 1992/1993. By controlling the operation of aerators, their effectiveness on P exchange at the sediment–water interface (non-aerated vs. aerated) was directly compared in spring and autumn between 2008 and 2010. The amount of P controllable by aeration (P control) was experimentally determined by non-aerated vs. aerated sediment cores (at 10 and 16 °C). Core stratigraphy of Fe was observed by high-resolution μX-ray fluorescence analysis.Results and discussionIn TEG, the mobility of Fe was limited due to its sulfidic fixation, and thus Fe only accumulated slightly at the sediment surface (Fe/P ratio, ∼3). P control corresponded to only 4 \% of the P content of the lake and 18 \% of P loading. Hence, aeration only slightly influenced trophy-relevant epilimnetic P. In GGS, the single Fe application still ensures a high P binding ability of sediment since Fe relocated towards the surface (Fe/P ratio, ∼7). P control corresponded to 38 \% of the P content of the lake and 74 \% of annual P loading. Thus, the P release is not relevant for the P supply to the epilimnion since with the lake’s overturn P is co-precipitated by the hypolimnetically accumulated Fe.ConclusionsWhen external P loading is sufficiently reduced, as in GGS, amendments to Fe precipitants can increase sediment P retention in a redox-dependent manner over the long term. Thus, the redox-dependent mobility of Fe should no longer be regarded as a disadvantage of Fe-containing precipitants. To compensate for co-precipitation and complexation of Fe with sediment organic matter, a high Fe dosage (≥200 g m−2) is needed.},

	abstract = {Climate forecasts project a global increase in extreme weather events, but information on the consequences for ecosystems is scarce. Of particular significance for lakes are severe storms that can influence biogeochemical processes and biological communities by disrupting the vertical thermal structure during periods of stratification. An exceptional storm passing over northern Germany in July 2011 provided an opportunity to assess the consequences and underlying mechanisms of such extreme events on the interplay between the physics and ecological characteristics of a deep, nutrient-poor lake. Wind speeds were among the most extreme on record. A suite of variables measured throughout the event consistently indicates that a cascade of processes pushed the clear-water lake into an exceptionally turbid state. Specifically, thermocline deepening by the storm-entrained cyanobacteria of a deep chlorophyll maximum located at about 8 m depth into the surface mixed layer. Released from light limitation, intense photosynthesis of the cyanobacteria boosted primary production, increased algal biomass, raised the pH and thus induced massive calcite precipitation to a level never observed within three decades of lake monitoring. As a consequence, water transparency dropped from 6.5 to 2.1 m, the minimum on record for 40 years, and the euphotic zone shrank by about 8 m for several weeks. These results show that cyanobacterial blooms not only are promoted by climate warming, but can also be triggered by extreme storms. Clear-water lakes developing a deep chlorophyll maximum appear to be particularly at risk in the future, if such events become more intense or frequent.},

	abstract = {Lakes all around the globe are under severe pressure due to an increasing anthropogenic  impact from a growing population in a more developed world. Accordingly, today, many lakes are  highly eutrophic and suffer from severe blooms of often toxic cyanobacteria and may become even  more eutrophic in the future unless strong lake management actions are taken. Recent research has  further shown that global warming and subsequent changes in water use will further exacerbate the  eutrophication process in lakes. There is therefore a growing demand for lake restoration and  insight into sustainable lake management. The measures to be taken, however, depend on the  climate and other local conditions. This special issue addresses lake restoration and management  with special emphasis on the restoration of eutrophicated lakes within a climate change perspective.  The papers included collectively highlight that the ongoing climate change affects lake water quality  by (1) changes in external and internal nutrient loading; (2) higher frequency of extreme events (such  as hurricanes); (3) temperature‐induced changes in biota, biotic interactions; and (4) water level.  Lower nutrient loading is therefore needed in a future warmer world to achieve the same ecological  state as today. Several papers discuss lake restoration methods within a climate change perspective  and show practical results, notably of various attempts of biomanipulation. Finally, some papers  discuss the effects of other anthropogenic stressors and their interaction with climate.},

To help avoid confusion between these concepts, this paper provides clear definitions of the residence time and the influence time. The similarities and differences between them are illustrated using both a simplified 1D advection–diffusion model and a realistic two-dimensional model of the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). The residence time of a water parcel in a control domain is the time taken by this parcel to leave the control domain for the first time. The influence time is the time required to replace the water in the domain of interest by renewing water. For steady flows, the influence time is numerically identical to the age of the renewing water, but the two timescales differ for unsteady flows. The residence time measures the influence of a hypothetical point discharge on a control domain. In environmental studies, it provides a measure of the effectiveness of hydrodynamic processes at helping a semi-enclosed basin to recover from a local pollution event. The influence time quantifies the local influence of a tracer that would be uniformly distributed in the control domain at the initial time. It is therefore a relevant diagnostic tool in impact studies focusing on the local persistence of a pollution problem initially affecting a large domain.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system is examined as a simpliﬁed model of the dynamics ensued by the Navier-Stokes equations. The model has a richer dynamical behaviour than the Burgers equation and shows several features similar to the ones that are associated with the threedimensional Navier-Stokes. Although the spatial dimension is only one, there are still three velocity components and three “directions.” The gradients along the transverse (virtual) directions are given by the product of the gradient along the real dimension and two arbitrary parameters, α and β, which can be either constant or variable. In general, diﬀerentiation with respect to the yand z-axis is replaced by diﬀerentiation in the x-axis and multiplication by α and β, respectively. This model, for various values of the two parameters, is solved numerically with a pseudo-spectral method and the results are analyzed. The dynamics of the proposed model diﬀers from the well studied dynamics of the Burgers equation. For example, in the case of variable coeﬃcients, the shock formation which characterizes Burger-like solutions is not present in the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Ensemble modelling was used to assess the robustness of projected impacts of pumped-storage (PS) operation and climate change on reservoir ice cover. To this end, three one-dimensional and a two-dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic model were set up. For the latter, the strength of the impacts with increasing distance from the dam was also investigated. Climate change effects were simulated by forcing the models with 150 years of synthetic meteorological time series created with a weather generator based on available air temperature scenarios for Switzerland. Future climate by the end of the 21st century was projected to shorten the ice-covered period by 2 months and decrease ice thicknesses by 13 cm. Under current climate conditions, the ice cover would already be affected by extended PS operation. For example, the average probability of ice coverage on a specific day was projected to decrease by 13\% for current climate and could further be reduced from 45\% to 10\% for future climate. Overall, the results of all models were consistent. Although the number of winters without ice cover was projected to increase for all one-dimensional models, studying individual segments of the two-dimensional model showed that the impact was pronounced for segments close to the PS intake/outlet. In summary, the reservoir's ice cover is expected to partially vanish with higher probability of open water conditions closer to the PS intake/outlet.},

	abstract = {One of the most important and interesting characteristics of a lake is its thermal structure. The heat content of a body of water is of vital importance in limnology. The metabolism, physiology, and behavior of aquatic organisms are related directly to the temperature of the aquatic environment. Extreme temperatures restrict the growth and distribution of plants, animals, and microbes. Because of the high specific heat of water, large volumes of water change temperature relatively slowly. Therefore, large lakes tend to moderate local climates, provide longer growing seasons for aquatic life, and serve as integrated recorders of recent climatic phenomena. For these and other reasons, the thermal structure and heat content of a body of water must be known with some degree of accuracy in limnological studies.Temperature is related to the heat content of a body of water but does not measure it. Tem­perature is a measure of the intensity of heat stored in a volume of water, not a measure of the amount of heat stored. Heat (H) is mea­sured in calories and is a function of the mass (M) of the substance in grams, temperature (t) in °C, and the specific heat (s) in cal/g-°C;† 𝐻=𝑀×𝑡×𝑠H=M×t×s H = M {\textbackslash}times t {\textbackslash}times s A bathtub filled with water at 0.5°C has a much greater heat content than does a glass filled with water at a temperature of 25°C.},

The flux enhancements predicted by Model 1 (Deardorff) for prevailing over-lake lapse conditions were inconsistent with measured changes in lake heat storage. When using the Budyko formulation for sky emissivity, ε, satisfactory energy residuals were obtained by eliminating the lapse enhancement while retaining the suppressive effects of over-lake inversions (Model 2 = modified Deardorff). Here, the best estimate of the 10 m Dalton coefficient was 1.45 × 10−3 (cgs units; neutral profile). However, when the Koberg model for ε was adopted instead, satisfactory energy residuals were obtained only after eliminating all adjustments for non-neutral conditions, and increasing the 10 m Dalton coefficient to approximately 1.55 × 10−3 (Model 3). Models 2 and 3 predicted annual evaporation from Lake Mendota of 71 and 86 cm during 1977 (including approximately 6 cm of sublimation during ice cover), bracketing earlier estimates for this locality (76 cm) based on U.S. Weather Bureau Class A pan data, and consistent with intensive studies of Pretty Lake in northern Indiana. My estimates of the 10 m Dalton coefficient (1.45 × 10−3 to 1.55 × 10−3) also narrowly bracket values for Lake Hefner and Lake Mead (1.49 × 10−3), obtained in studies by the U.S. Geological Survey. Moreover, as in the case of the Will Rogers airport near Lake Hefner, meteorologic data collected at Truax Airfield, Wisconsin, proved adequate for estimating sensible and latent heat transfer over the adjacent lake.},

The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.
RATIONALE The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).
RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).
CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6223/1259855/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.
The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.
Developments in the planetary boundaries concept provide a framework to support global sustainability.

We identified seasonal patterns of WT variability and showed that WT variability increases with increasing Schmidt stability, decreasing Lake number and decreasing ice cover duration, and is higher near the shore than in open water. We introduced the slope of WT spectra as an indicator for the degree of lake mixing to help explain the identified temporal and spatial scales of WT variability.

The onset and duration of the upwelling events correlated well with the balance between stratification (in terms of Schmidt stability) and wind forcing, as expressed by Lake and Wedderburn numbers. The period of regular upwelling appearances lasted 7–15 days, identified by Schmidt stabilities around 30 J m−2 and Lake numbers between 0 and 1, and resulted in persistent temperature gradients of up to 2°C across the lake surface. Our results suggest that spring upwelling should inevitably take place in all freshwater temperate lakes with mean temperatures crossing the maximum density value of freshwater on annual cycle, whereas duration and intensity of the upwelling would vary depending on lake morphometry and weather conditions. Our results suggest major contribution of upwelling in nutrient supply to the upper waters, oxygenation of the deep water column, and air-lake gas exchange, in particular, the release of the sediment-produced methane into the atmosphere.},

To demonstrate the universality ofthis parameter, LNvalues are used to describe the extent ofdeep mixing and are compared with changes in DO concentrations in three reservoirs in Australia and four lakes in the U.S.A., which vary in productivity and mixing regimes. A simple model is developed which relates changes in LNvalues, i.e., the extent of mixing, to changes in near bottom DO concentrations. After calibrating the model for a specific system, it is possible to use real-time LNvalues, calculated using water temperature profiles and surface wind velocities, to estimate changes in DO concentrations (assuming unchanged trophic conditions).},

Although controlled principally by morphometric factors, the degree of shelter from wind and the extent of each lake's dystrophy also had considerable effects. These factors allowed only surface waters to contribute to the annual heat exchange cycle, thereby reducing the magnitude of each lake's heat budgets and influencing stability and wind work values. The lakes show considerable short- and long-term fluctuations in heat content, stability and wind work values in response to the capricious maritime meteorological conditions of the area. However, long periods between successive samplings may have caused some underestimation of the ranges of these three parameters. Despite this, the study reveals that these standard energy parameters are effective in describing the annual energy input and resistance to wind-induced mixing of these dystrophic Tasmanian lakes.},

It is found that in the unstable marine surface layer, ζ = C Rib(1 + Rib/Ribc)−1, where the numerical coefficient C and the saturation Richardson number Ribc are analytical functions of the standard bulk exchange coefficients. For measurements at a height of 10–15 m, C is about 10 and Ribc is about −4.5. Their values are insensitive to variations of Rib and ζ over three decades. Thus, a simple dependence between ζ and Rib has a much wider range of applicability than previously believed. The authors show that this behavior is the result of the effects of “gustiness” driven by boundary layer–scale convective eddies. The derived relationship can be used as a first guess for ζ in bulk flux routines and reduces or eliminates the need for lengthy iterative solutions. Using this approximation yields errors in the latent heat flux of a few watts per square meter, compared to the full iterative solution.},

	abstract = {Hutchinson and Löffler's (1956) classification of lakes based on the seasonal thermal mixing regime has become a cornerstone of any analysis of lakes as elements of the earth surface. Until now however the lake classification has lacked a physically sound quantitative criterion distinguishing between two fundamental lake types: thermally stratified during a large portion of the year (mono- and dimictic) and predominantly mixed to the bottom (polymictic). Using the mechanistic balance between potential and kinetic energy we review the different formulations of the Richardson number to derive a generalized scaling for seasonal stratification in a closed lake basin. The scaling parameter is the critical mean basin depth, Hcrit, that delineates lakes that mix regularly from those that stratify seasonally based on lake water transparency, lake length, and an annual mean estimate for the Monin-Obukhov length. We validate the scaling on available data of lakes worldwide using logistic regression. The scaling criterion consistently described the mixing regime significantly better than either the conventional unbounded basin scaling or a simple depth threshold. Thus, the generalized scaling is universal for freshwater lakes and allows the seasonal mixing regime to be estimated without numerically solving the heat transport equations.},

The ability to model lake-ice freeze-up, break-up, total ice thickness and ice type offers the potential to describe the effects of climate change in these regions. Model output is validated against lake-ice observations made during the winter of 1992–93 in Glacier National Park, Montana. U.S.A. The model is driven with observed daily atmospheric forcing of precipitation, wind speed and air temperature. In addition to simulating complete energy-balance components over the annual cycle, model output includes ice freeze-up and break-up dates, and the end-of-season clear ice, snow-ice and total ice depths for two nearby lakes in Glacier National Park, each in a different topographic setting. Modeled ice features are found to agree closely with the lake-ice observations.
Model simulations illustrate the key role that the wind component of the local climatic regime plays on the growth and decay of lake ice. The wind speed affects both the surface temperature and the accumulation of snow on the lake-ice surface. Higher snow accumulations on the lake ice depress the ice surface below the water line, causing the snow to become saturated and leading to the formation of snow-ice deposits. In regions having higher wind speeds, significantly less snow accumulates on the lake-ice surface, thus limiting snow-ice formation. The ice produced by these two different mechanisms has distinctly different optical and radiative properties, and affects the monitoring of frozen lakes using remote-sensing techniques.},

	abstract = {Lakes are active processors of organic carbon (OC) and play important roles in landscape and global carbon cycling. Allochthonous OC loads from the landscape, along with autochthonous OC loads from primary production, are mineralized in lakes, buried in lake sediments, and exported via surface or groundwater outflows. Although these processes provide a basis for a conceptual understanding of lake OC budgets, few studies have integrated these fluxes under a dynamic modeling framework to examine their interactions and relative magnitudes. We developed a simple, dynamic mass balance model for OC, and applied the model to a set of five lakes. We examined the relative magnitudes of OC fluxes and found that long-term ({\textgreater}10 year) lake OC dynamics were predominantly driven by allochthonous loads in four of the five lakes, underscoring the importance of terrestrially-derived OC in northern lake ecosystems. Our model highlighted seasonal patterns in lake OC budgets, with increasing water temperatures and lake productivity throughout the growing season corresponding to a transition from burial- to respiration-dominated OC fates. Ratios of respiration to burial, however, were also mediated by the source (autochthonous vs. allochthonous) of total OC loads. Autochthonous OC is more readily respired and may therefore proportionally reduce burial under a warming climate, but allochthonous OC may increase burial due to changes in precipitation. The ratios of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs and respiration to burial demonstrate the importance of dynamic models for examining both the seasonal and inter-annual roles of lakes in landscape and global carbon cycling, particularly in a global change context. Finally, we highlighted critical data needs, which include surface water DOC observations in paired tributary and lake systems, measurements of OC burial rates, groundwater input volume and DOC, and budgets of particulate OC.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThermal stratification in reservoirs is a significant factor affecting water quality, and can be strongly influenced by climate change and operational strategies. Reservoirs in the temperate zone react most sensitively to climate warming during winter as ice cover and inversed stratification are about to disappear in a warmer world. In this study, two well-established hydrodynamic models, the one-dimensional General Lake Model (GLM) and the two-dimensional CE-QUAL-W2 (W2), were used to investigate the response of winter inversed stratification in the Rappbode Reservoir to future climate warming, combined with different water withdrawal elevations.ResultsUnder increased air temperature, the duration of inversed stratification is reduced and the inversion phenomenon will entirely disappear under current management if the air temperature is increased high enough (more than 4.5 K) in the future. Under strong climate warming, the Rappbode Reservoir will therefore change from a dimictic to a monomictic mixing type. Changing the reservoir management from deep withdrawal (e.g., below 350 m a.s.l.) to shallow withdrawal elevations (e.g., above 390 m a.s.l.) reduces internal heat energy stored in the reservoir in summer and prolongs the inversed stratification period in winter. This strategy can retain the dimictic behavior even under strong warming.ConclusionsOur study indicates that adjusting the withdrawal elevation is an effective management instrument to control the winter conditions and can, in fact, mitigate climate warming effects on winter hydrodynamics by stabilizing the dimictic mixing type.},

A coupled ecological and hydrodynamic model (Dynamic Reservoir Model (DYRESM)–Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM)) was validated with an extensive field data set to simulate the seasonal dynamics of nutrients, three phytoplankton groups and three zooplankton groups. Parameterization of the model was conducted using field, experimental and literature studies. Sensitivity of simulated output was tested over the full parameter space and established that the most sensitive parameters were related to zooplankton grazing rates, temperature responses and food limitation. The simulated results predict that, on average, 51\% of the carbon from phytoplankton photosynthesis is consumed by zooplankton. Excretion of dissolved nutrients by zooplankton accounts for 3–46 and 5–58\% of phytoplankton uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen, respectively. Comparison of nutrient fluxes attributable to zooplankton with nutrient loads from inflows and release from bottom sediments shows that the relative contribution by zooplankton to inorganic nutrients in the photic zone varies seasonally in response to the annual hydrodynamic cycle of stratification and mixing. As a percent of total dissolved organic sources relative contributions by zooplankton excretion are highest (62\%) during periods of stratification and when inflow nutrient loads are low, and lowest (2\%) during the breakdown of stratification and when inflow loads are high. The results illustrate the potential of a lake ecosystem model to extract useful process information to complement field data collection and address questions related to the role of zooplankton in nutrient cycles.},

First we show that the output data allows for assessing the long term effects of past climate change on the thermal structure of a lake. In the second case, we demonstrate how the data platform can be used to study and compare the role of episodic strong wind events for different lakes on a regional scale and especially how they temporary destabilize their thermal structure.

Whereas the classical cooling-induced and shear-induced convections are well-known phenomena due to their dominant roles in ocean basins, other convective processes are specific to lakes and often overlooked, for example, sidearm, under-ice, and double-diffusive convection or thermobaric instability and bioconvection. Additionally, the peculiar properties of the density function at low salinities/temperatures leave distinctive traces. In this review, we present these various processes and connect observations with theories and model results.},

The radon flux F from the bottom is calculated from 226Ra in the sediments and corrected for depth variation of porosity and radium activity. In Baldeggersee (Switzerland), F is 390 ± 70 dpm·m‒2·d‒1. Radium activities in the sediments are 0.7 ± 0.2 dpm·g‒1 dry mass, similar to those in other Swiss lakes and in coastal areas of the ocean but 20–50 times smaller than in the deep Pacific. Horizontal diffusivity in the hypolimnion decreases from June (5,000 m2·d‒1) to October (1,000 m2·d‒1); vertical diffusivity is between 1 and 10 m2·d‒1, roughly 10 times larger than values calculated from temperature in the upper hypolimnion. Vertical buoyancy flux is between 10‒11 and 10‒10 m2·s‒3, i.e. between values for the deep ocean and the small ELA lakes in Canada. The large Kz and the transient, often irregular shape of the radon profiles are the result of horizontal bottom currents previously measured by other methods.},

Oxygen depletion processes in lakes are still not completely understood and a variety of models have been proposed based on limited field observations. Here, we present field measurements of oxygen depletion processes in a deep lake, Lake Geneva (Switzerland). The aim of this study was to quantify three basic processes controlling hypolimnetic oxygen depletion and their relative contribution to the total oxygen depletion (TOD) rate. Sediment oxygen uptake (SOU) and the flux of reduced substances were estimated based on oxygen microprofile measurements and sediment core data of reduced substances. Acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements and hydrodynamic modeling were used to ensure that SOU was measured under typical hydrodynamic conditions. Comparison with long-term monitoring data allowed for an estimate of the relative importance of SOU and water column mineralization (WCM). Results show a decrease in both SOU and WCM down to mid-depth which could not be explained by changes in hydrodynamic conditions or temperature. Below mid-depth, TOD increased due to an enhanced sediment area to water volume ratio (α). This vertical pattern of oxygen depletion is driven by (1) lake morphometry paired with increasing α, and (2) decreasing organic matter mineralization in the water column with depth. The findings are explained by a model which separates the oxygen depletion into an exponentially decreasing component, representing the fast-decaying fraction of the organic matter, and a constant background component.},

	abstract = {Oxygen depletion (temporal or permanent) in freshwater ecosystems is a widespread and globally important environmental problem. However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picos de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013–2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification. Global warming may indirectly increase anoxia in many other mountain lakes in the near future.},

The investigation shows: 1. Vertical mixing coefficients below 25 m are small. Consequently the vertical concentration distribution of sediment emanating species in the deep hypolimnion is controlled by the bottom topography. 2. Renewal of deep hypolimnic water is significant even during stratification. 3. Weakly damped internal waves characterize the internal dynamics during stratification. 4. Horizontal bottom currents play an important role in the hypolimnion mixing and can be correlated to internal waves during stratification.},

The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

VOD values increased as temperature and phosphorus retention increased. Rates were inversely proportional to the ratio of the volume of the stratum divided by the area of sediments that are contiguous to the stratum. The statistical model was tested by measuring VOD values in an independent group of 12 lakes. Predictions agreed well with the measured values. An analysis of the combined data explained 91\% of the variance in VOD values. The regression correctly predicted the vertical variation in VOD values in lakes that exhibited negative heterograde, orthograde, and clinograde oxygen profiles.

Dynamic or mechanistic models and empirical or statistical methods have been used to integrate the physical processes in lakes enabling the response of the thermal structure to changes in air temperature to be determined. Water temperature records for Lake Mendota, WI., are possibly the most extensive for any dimictic lake in the world and allowed both approaches to be used. Results from both techniques suggest the mixed layer temperature increases with increasing air temperature. Results from the empirical approach suggested epilimnion temperatures increase 0.5 to 1.0°C per 1.0°C increase in air temperature compared to 0.4 to 0.85°C estimated from a dynamical model (DYRESM). Increased air temperatures are related to significant warming in deep water temperatures in the absence of stratification; however, mid summer hypolimnion temperatures are expected to change very little or increase only slightly in response to climatic warming. Both approaches suggest increases in air temperatures increase the length of summer stratification; results from the dynamic model suggest an increase of approximately 5 days per 1°C increase in air temperature. Longer stratification is reflected in shallower late summer thermocline depths. With these quantitative relationships and forecast increases in air temperature for the 2 × CO2 climatic scenario (Greenhouse Effect) from three General Circulation Models, projections are made describing the changes in the future mean thermal structure of moderate to large sized lakes.},

	abstract = {The increase in strength and duration of summer stratification in temperate lakes is a well-described sentinel of climatic change reported in numerous lake studies. The definitions of the onset of thermal stratification in early spring and its breakup during the autumn overturn are usually binary thresholds chosen on a subjective basis. However, the transition phases between mixing and stagnation (start of summer stratification) and between stagnation and mixing (end of summer stratification) are continuous processes. Therefore, the time limits of the stratified period are definition-dependent, which complicates comparison of results from different studies. An experimental determination of the duration of summ­ er stratification needs unified criteria to decide when stratification is established and when it terminates. We demonstrate that the termination of the stratified period (start of autumn mixing) can be detected with sufficient accuracy from near bottom temperature records at the deepest point of the lake. Nevertheless, it takes days after this moment until the whole water column is mixed completely and a stability threshold is required for the end of the stratified period. To define the beginning of the stratified period, thresholds for different stability indices were suggested previously. Although the threshold choice influences the estimated duration of stratification each year, it appears not to significantly affect the long-term trends of stratification. More important than the selection of stability thresholds is therefore the quality of observational data used for analysis. Using measured data from two dimictic Lakes in Northern Germany we show that the estimation of the stratification length depends strongly on the temporal resolution of the measurements. For comparative studies which aim to verify a shift in future temperate lake stratification experimentally, we suggest (i) to use data from high-resolution water temperature probes (discarding completely data sets with weekly, biweekly or sparser sampling period), (ii) to use a consistent stability threshold (e.g. a fixed value of Schmidt stability) to derive the duration of the stratified period uniformly, and (iii) to apply standardized algorithms in large intercomparison studies to determine indices of stratification.},

	abstract = {Hypolimnetic oxygenation is an increasingly common lake management strategy for mitigating hypoxia/anoxia and associated deleterious effects on water quality. A common effect of oxygenation is increased oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion and predicting the magnitude of this increase is the crux of effective oxygenation system design. Simultaneous measurements of sediment oxygen flux (JO2) and turbulence in the bottom boundary layer of two oxygenated lakes were used to investigate the impact of oxygenation on JO2. Oxygenation increased JO2 in both lakes by increasing the bulk oxygen concentration, which in turn steepens the diffusive gradient across the diffusive boundary layer. At high flow rates, the diffusive boundary layer thickness decreased as well. A transect along one of the lakes showed JO2 to be spatially quite variable, with near-field and far-field JO2 differing by a factor of 4. Using these in situ measurements, physical models of interfacial flux were compared to microprofile-derived JO2 to determine which models adequately predict JO2 in oxygenated lakes. Models based on friction velocity, turbulence dissipation rate, and the integral scale of turbulence agreed with microprofile-derived JO2 in both lakes. These models could potentially be used to predict oxygenation-induced oxygen flux and improve oxygenation system design methods for a broad range of reservoir systems.},

	abstract = {Hypolimnetic oxygenation is an increasingly common lake management strategy for mitigating hypoxia/anoxia and associated deleterious effects on water quality. A common effect of oxygenation is increased oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion and predicting the magnitude of this increase is the crux of effective oxygenation system design. Simultaneous measurements of sediment oxygen flux (J(O2)) and turbulence in the bottom boundary layer of two oxygenated lakes were used to investigate the impact of oxygenation on J(O2). Oxygenation increased J(O2) in both lakes by increasing the bulk oxygen concentration, which in turn steepens the diffusive gradient across the diffusive boundary layer. At high flow rates, the diffusive boundary layer thickness decreased as well. A transect along one of the lakes showed J(O2) to be spatially quite variable, with near-field and far-field J(O2) differing by a factor of 4. Using these in situ measurements, physical models of interfacial flux were compared to microprofile-derived J(O2) to determine which models adequately predict J(O2) in oxygenated lakes. Models based on friction velocity, turbulence dissipation rate, and the integral scale of turbulence agreed with microprofile-derived J(O2) in both lakes. These models could potentially be used to predict oxygenation-induced oxygen flux and improve oxygenation system design methods for a broad range of reservoir systems.},

	abstract = {Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion has been recognized as a problem in the central basin of Lake Erie since the 1970s. However, recent expansion in distribution of the depletion after several years of low depletion rates in the 1990s has led investigators to explore the factors that influence the extent of the depletion. We have investigated the vertical oxygen budget in the central basin, which is influenced by the following factors: 1) vertical mixing; 2) exchange across the air-water interface; 3) photosynthesis; 4) respiration of plankton; and 5) sediment oxygen demand. We tested the importance of these factors using a 1-D vertical oxygen budget and transport simulations through sensitivity analysis and by estimating vertical mixing parameters using a temperature gradient microprofiler. Epilimnetic factors were found to be robust and the present monitoring efforts are sufficient; while epilimnetic production is ultimately the source of the hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, epilimnetic factors do not directly influence on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. However, hypolimnetic depletion was sensitive to sediment oxygen demand and hypolimnion respiration, which are the results of primary production in the epilimnion, and hypolimnetic mixing, which is not related to eutrophication. These parameters, especially the physical mixing measurements, and their links with eutrophication and primary production require greater monitoring and analysis because of their influence on the expansion of oxygen depletion in the central basin of Lake Erie.},

This lake supplies approximately four million people with drinking water and has undergone strong re-oligotrophication over the past decades. We calculated depth-specific annual oxygen depletion rates (ODRs) during the period of stratification and found that 50\% of the observed variability in ODR was already explained by a simple separation into a sediment- and volume-related oxygen consumption. Adding a linear factor for water depth further improved the model indicating that oxygen depletion increased substantially along the depth. Two other factors turned out to significantly influence ODR: total phosphorus as a proxy for the lake’s trophic state and mean oxygen concentration in the respective depth layer. Our analysis points to the importance of nutrient reductions as effective management measures to improve and protect the oxygen status of such large and deep lakes.},

The present study aimed to assess temporal fluctuations in the lake's thermal stability from 1978 to 2011 to understand the influence of regional climate change on hypolimnetic anoxia in this lake. Because complete vertical mixing, which supplies dissolved oxygen (DO) to the hypolimnion, potentially occurs on February, we calculated the Schmidt stability index (S) in February and compared it with hypolimnetic DO dynamics. Vertical water temperature profiles were calculated using a one-dimensional model, and calculated temperatures and meteorological data were used to analyse annual fluctuations in water temperatures, thermocline depth, meteorological variables and S. We estimated that mean annual air and volume-weighted water temperatures increased by 0.028 and 0.033 °C year−1, respectively, from 1978 to 2011. Between 1986 and 1990, S and water temperature increased abruptly, probably due to a large upwards trend in air temperature (+0.239 °C year−1). We hypothesize that a mixing regime that lacked overturn took effect at this time and that this regime lasted until 2011, when S was particularly small. These results demonstrate that abrupt climate warming in the late 1980s likely triggered the termination of complete mixing and caused the 21-year period of successive anoxia in Lake Ikeda. We conclude that the lake response to a rapid shift in regional climate conditions was a key factor in changing the hypolimnetic water environment and that thermal stability in winter is a critical environmental factor controlling the mixing regime and anoxic conditions in deep lakes.

	abstract = {Oxygen depletion (temporal or permanent) in freshwater ecosystems is a widespread and globally important environmental problem. However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picos de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013–2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification. Global warming may indirectly increase anoxia in many other mountain lakes in the near future.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations in lakes and to track changes in concentrations over time in response to known environmental stressors is critical for effective lake management. The background concentrations of deepwater oxygen, in particular, provide important management benchmarks for assessing the impact of current and future shoreline residential development on water quality. Background can be defined as the conditions that exist in the absence of, or prior to, human influence. We compare 2 models commonly used to predict end-of-summer, volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (VWHO) concentrations in Canadian Shield lakes. The paleoecological and empirical models are evaluated in their ability to predict present-day VWHO concentrations, and then compared in their predictions of background VWHO concentrations and in predictions of changes in VWHO from background to present-day conditions. The predictive power of the 59-lake paleoecological model (jackknifed r2 = 0.51, RMSEP = 2.18 mg/L) is comparable to other models that have used chironomids to predict the degree of hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes but is lower than that produced by the empirical modelling approach (r2 = 0.87, SE = 1.04 mg/L). However, this discrepancy may be offset by the enhanced realism of the paleoecological model, including its ability to predict declines in VWHO over time. The combined use of the paleoecological and empirical modelling approaches may allow lake managers to examine changes in deepwater oxygen concentrations in response to a single “targeted” stressor (e.g., residential shoreline development) and to multiple environmental stressors (e.g., climate change, hydrological management).},

The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

There are no easy ways to quantify exeedences of important thresholds of DO in lakes, except the complete lack of DO, quantified as an annual or seasonal anoxic factor (Nürnberg 1995a, b). Here an analogous concept, the “Hypoxic Factor” (HF) is introduced. According to specific water quality standards, certain levels of oxygen depletion can be quantified, e.g., DO concentrations below 5 mg L−1 or 6.5 mg L−1. The HF is computed from the duration and extent of hypoxia by using DO profiles and hypsographic data. It is expressed in such a way that a value of 365 d yr−1 would mean the whole lake has a DO concentration below the specified level at all times. The application to a TMDL project, where DO standards are to be employed in a large Snake River reservoir, demonstrates the potential usefulness of HF. This quantification of hypoxia allows the testing of hypotheses, e.g., the dependency of hypoxia on stage height, flow and nutrients. Significant relationships were found between annual expressions of hypoxia and hydrological variables (seasonal flows, water retention time) and a climatic index.},

Assessments of oxygen resources are based on DO profiles of 1 m resolution conducted hourly to weekly during April-October. Closure of an industry that operated on the lake's shore until 1986 resulted in an abrupt decrease in primary production and organic carbon deposition and marked changes in hypolimnetic and epilimnetic DO regimes. The hypolimnetic DO response was gradual, reflecting the influence of sediment feedback. The onset of complete hypolimnetic anoxia, which occurred by early June through the 1980s, took place approximately one month later over 1997–2002. The anoxic factor decreased significantly over the study interval, from 97±5 d to 67±2 d. Epilimnetic DO concentrations responded rapidly to the abrupt change in lake metabolism. Before closure of the industry, 41\% of the April to mid-September DO observations deviated from saturation concentrations by {\textgreater}30\%. In the years immediately following industry closure, this degree of disequilibrium occurred in 23\% of DO observations. Percent saturation values during fall turnover increased gradually during the study, from 49±2 to 65±2. DO concentrations in the lake's upper waters have been subject to substantial diel fluctuations ({\textgreater}4 mg/L), with daily minima and maxima generally occurring at approximately 7:00 and 16:00, respectively. Measurements made at 11:00 and 22:00 were most likely to be representative of daily average conditions. Diel variations and sampling frequency were demonstrated to be important issues for the evaluation of status with respect to water quality standards for DO. Levels of DO in the lake's upper waters have been positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations (r = 0.52). Despite marked improvements in DO resources, the lake continues to lack cool, well-oxygenated waters during summer necessary to support coldwater fish species.},

	abstract = {The dissolved oxygen concentrations in Darwin River Reservoir (DRR) and Manton River Reservoir (MRR), both located in the wet/dry tropics of Australia, were investigated over an 8-year period. Average oxygen concentrations were lower in MRR than in DRR, indicating the dominance of consumptive processes not compensated by photosynthetic production of oxygen, despite MRR’s higher chlorophyll a concentration. With the onset of thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion of each reservoir was depleted at average rates of 3.4–7.1 mg L−1 month−1. These are higher than rates reported for temperate water-bodies (0.10–3.0 mg L−1 month−1). This was ascribed primarily to the effect of temperature on microbial metabolism, while the influence of the reservoirs’ high epilimnion to hypolimnion volumetric ratios (approximately 10:1) and reservoir trophic state were considered secondary. Due to the temperature dependence of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, the trophic classification of lakes based on hypolimnetic deoxygenation and anoxia is not globally applicable, but is applicable to water-bodies of similar hypolimnetic temperatures, especially when morphometric influences are also taken into account. Both reservoirs experienced long periods of anoxia (average: 9 months in MRR, 5 months in DRR). In DRR, the extent of hypolimnetic anoxia was related to hypolimnion volume. Hypolimnetic anoxia in the reservoirs, when quantified by the anoxic factor (AF; number of days that a sediment area, equal to the whole-lake surface area, is overlain by anoxic waters), was high compared with similar water-bodies in North America, providing quantitative evidence that anoxia in more prevalent in tropical reservoirs. Ammonia, iron and manganese accumulated in the hypolimnion of both DRR and MRR, with concentrations decreasing exponentially from the sediments to the oxycline. Sediment phosphorus release was detected in MRR, but not detected in DRR, despite the reservoir’s long periods of hypolimnetic anoxia. The high water temperatures and lengthy periods of hypolimnetic anoxia of the reservoirs provided a favourable environment for anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria.},

Most model inputs, and many of the kinetic coefficients, were developed through a program of field monitoring and field and laboratory experimentation. The model was calibrated and verified using data collected in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Severe dissolved oxygen depletion is observed in the hypolimnion (lower mixed layer; LML) of Onondaga Lake during summer stratification. SOD and water column oxidation of reduced species diffusing from the sediment are together responsible for {\textgreater}70\% of the summer depletion; CBOD, NBOD and algal respiration account for the balance. DO depletion occurs in the epilimnion (upper mixed layer; UML) in the fall. Oxidation of reduced species entrained from the LML is responsible for about 30\% of the fall depletion, with algal respiration and mass transport to the LML accounting for about 25\% each; CBOD and NBOD are minor sinks. Beyond those features of pollutant loading, fate, and transport, sensitivity analyses suggest mat meteorological conditions importantly influence the character of the DO resources of the lake.},

	abstract = {1. We analysed 41 years of data (1968–2008) from Blelham Tarn, U.K., to determine the consequences of eutrophication and climate warming on hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO). 2. The establishment of thermal stratification was strongly related to the onset of DO depletion in the lower hypolimnion. As a result of a progressively earlier onset of stratification and later overturn, the duration of stratification increased by 38 ± 8 days over the 41 years. 3. The observed rate of volumetric hypolimnetic oxygen depletion (VHODobs) ranged from 0.131 to 0.252 g O2 m−3 per day and decreased significantly over the study period, despite the increase in the mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in the growing season. The vertical transport of DO represented from 0 to 30\% of VHODobs, while adjustments for interannual differences in hypolimnetic temperature were less important, ranging from −11 to 9\% of VHODobs. 4. The mean wind speed during May made the strongest significant contribution to the variation in VHODobs. VHODobs adjusted for the vertical transport of DO and hypolimnetic temperature differences, VHODadj, was significantly related to the upper mixed layer Chl a concentration during spring. 5. Hypolimnetic anoxia (HA) ranged from 27 to 168 days per year and increased significantly over time, which undoubtedly had negative ecological consequences for the lake. 6. In similar small temperate lakes, the negative effects of eutrophication on hypolimnetic DO are likely to be exacerbated by changes in lake thermal structure brought about by a warming climate, which may undermine management efforts to alleviate the effects of anthropogenic eutrophication.},

The geometric means of summer surface average nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) concentration, phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll concentration), and hypolimnetic anoxia (anoxic factor) were significantly higher in coloured than in clear lakes. The regressions of colour or DOC on these trophic state variables were positive and significant throughout a range of three orders of magnitude. Phytoplankton or primary productivity was higher in coloured lakes, when expressed per volume of epilimnion. Annual integral primary productivity expressed on an areal basis was smaller in coloured lakes, probably a reflection of shallower phototrophic depths in these lakes. There is evidence that annual integral bacteria productivity is much higher in coloured lakes for two reasons: first, epilimnetic bacteria production was ca. four times higher in coloured lakes, second, other studies have shown that hypolimnetic bacteria production is commonly higher than epilimnetic production, especially in anoxic hypolimnia that are frequent in coloured lakes. All volumetrically expressed variables indicated higher productivity in coloured lakes. In addition, high bacteria productivity reflects a different food chain involving mixotrophs, possibly compensating for low light conditions. Our analyses indicate that primary and secondary productivity is as high as or higher than in clear lakes.},

Because the contributions of each inflow have not yet been quantified and because the lake features complex bathymetry and numerous islands, a hydrodynamic circulation model with high spatial resolution and dynamic wind forcing is useful. We applied the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model to separate the influences of wind and river discharge on the currents and mass transport in Lake Tegel. For model validation, we compared the simulation results with 1 year of electrical conductivity data, which was used as a conservative tracer to distinguish between water from the River Havel and water supplied by a smaller second inflow. Calculation of currents alone is insufficient to investigate water exchanges between rivers and lakes, especially when several islands create multiple pathways for river intrusion. Therefore, mass transport simulations are applied. Our calculations based on archetypical scenarios indicate that the proportion of (polluted) water from the River Havel in the main basin of Lake Tegel fluctuates with river discharge and wind, which either amplify or neutralize each other.},

Stability indices, including Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, and thermocline depth are calculated according to established literature definitions and returned to the user in a time series format. The program was created for the analysis of high-frequency data collected from instrumented lake buoys, in support of the emerging field of aquatic sensor network science. Available outputs for the Lake Analyzer program are: water temperature (error-checked and/or down-sampled), wind speed (error-checked and/or down-sampled), metalimnion extent (top and bottom), thermocline depth, friction velocity, Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, mode-1 vertical seiche period, and Brunt-Väisälä buoyancy frequency. Secondary outputs for several of these indices delineate the parent thermocline depth (seasonal thermocline) from the shallower secondary or diurnal thermocline. Lake Analyzer provides a program suite and best practices for the comparison of mixing and stratification indices in lakes across gradients of climate, hydro-physiography, and time, and enables a more detailed understanding of the resulting biogeochemical transformations at different spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Oxygen concentration is both an indicator and driver of water quality in lakes. Decreases in oxygen concentration leads to altered ecosystem function as well as harmful consequences for aquatic biota, such as fishes. The responses of oxygen dynamics in lakes to climate-related drivers, such as temperature and wind speed, are well documented for lake surface waters. However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.},

	abstract = {Two powerful formulas have been available to scientists for more than two centuries: Newton's second law, providing a foundation for classical physics, and Bayes's theorem, prescribing probabilistic learning about unknown quantities based on observations. For the most part the use of these formulas has been separated, with Newton being the more dominant in geophysics. This separation is arguably surprising since numerous sources of uncertainty arise in the application of classical physics in complex situations. One explanation for the separation is the difficulty in implementing Bayesian analysis in complex settings. However, recent advances in both modeling strategies and computational tools have contributed to a significant change in the scope and feasibility of Bayesian analysis. This paradigm provides opportunities for the combination of physical reasoning and observational data in a coherent analysis framework but in a fashion which manages the uncertainties in both information sources. A key to the modeling is the hierarchical viewpoint, in which separate statistical models are developed for the process variables studied and for the observations conditional on those variables. Modeling process variables in this way enables the incorporation of physics across a spectrum of levels of intensity, ranging from a qualitative use of physical reasoning to a strong reliance on numerical models. Selected examples from this spectrum are reviewed. So far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain. And so far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.Albert Einstein (1921)},

Coupled to GOTM is a biological model that includes phytoplankton, detritus, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, chlorophyll and oxygen. We performed model ensemble runs by introducing variations in the biological parameters, each of which was assigned a probability distribution. We compare and contrast here 2 sequential data assimilation methods: the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and sequential importance resampling (SIR). We assimilated different types of BATS observations, including particulate organic nitrogen, nitrate+nitrite, chlorophyll a and oxygen for the 2-year period from January 1990 to December 1991, and quantified the impact of the data assimilation on the model's predictive skill. By applying a cross-validation to the data-assimilative and deterministic simulations we found that the predictive skill was improved for 2-week forecasts. In our experiments the EnKF, which exhibited a stronger effect on the ensemble during the assimilation step, showed slightly higher improvements in the predictive skill than the SIR, which preserves dynamical model consistency in our implementation. Our numerical experiments show that statistical properties stabilize for ensemble sizes of 20 or greater with little improvement for larger ensembles.},

It is concluded that the terrestrial organic matter plays an important role in inﬂuencing interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Based on the ﬂuctuations of lake ecosystem, we further develop a stochastically perturbed model. Theoretic analysis implies that the stochastic model exists a stationary distribution which is ergodic.

	abstract = {abstract: Spatial heterogeneity in organism and resource distributions can generate temporal heterogeneity in resource access for simple organisms like phytoplankton. The role of temporal heterogeneity as a structuring force for simple communities is investigated via models of phytoplankton with contrasting life histories competing for a single fluctuating resource. A stochastic model in which environmental and demographic stochasticity are treated separately is compared with a model with deterministic resource variation to assess the importance of stochasticity. When compared with the deterministic model, the stochastic model allows for coexistence over a wider range of parameter values (or life‐history types). The model suggests that demographic stochasticity alone is far more important in increasing the possibility of coexistence than environmental stochasticity alone. However, the combined effects of both types of stochasticity produce the largest likelihood of coexistence. Finally, the influence of relative nutrient levels and nutrient pulse frequency on these results is addressed. We relate our findings to variable environment theory with evidence for both relative nonlinearity and the storage effect acting in this model. We show for the first time that temporal dynamics generated by demographic stochasticity may operate like the storage effect at particular spatial scales.},

However, ecosystem models often fail to agree with observations. This failure can be due to inadequacies in the data and/or inadequacies in the model formulation and parameterization. Here we parameterize and optimize a two-phytoplankton functional type model of phytoplankton growth rate and chlorophyll/carbon (Chl:C) ratio using data from the Lagrangian field measurements conducted during process cruises of the Long-Term Ecosystem Research–California Current Ecosystem (CCE) program. We parameterize the model based on a small coastal subset of the data and then extend and test it with the full data set, including data from offshore regions. The CCE process studies were focused on quantifying the size-resolved planktonic growth, grazing, production, and export rates while following water parcels. The resulting data therefore provided strong constraints for the model we employed. The modeled growth rates and Chl:C ratios were in good agreement with observations. Our results indicate that the model can accurately predict Chl:C ratios, biomasses, and growth rates of dominant functional types using relatively easily measured environmental variables (temperature, nutrients, and bulk chlorophyll). The model also accurately reproduces the subsurface maxima of growth rates, the spatial separation of carbon and chlorophyll maxima, and many other observations in the California Current coastal and pelagic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The principle of “competitive exclusion” predicts that no two species can occupy the same ecological niche at the same time and place (Hardin, 1960). Hutchinson (1953, 1961) suggested that the vast diversity of phytoplankton observed in many aquatic environments presents an apparent contradiction to this principle. Since all phytoplankton compete for the same basic resources, and since the euphotic zones of most natural waters are relatively homogeneous, such coexisting plankters appear to be simultaneously occupying the same niche. In this paper we present simulation results from a mathematical model wherein we examine the hypothesis that physical turbulence in an aquatic system can mollify interactive pressures between plankton populations and allow coexistence of species competing for the same resources. Using Bella's (1972) highly simplified model as a point of departure, we develop a new model, explicitly incorporating gross physiological mechanisms, to investigate the effects of both advective and turbulent components of water movement on the growth of three competing phytoplankton species. We observed that, in the absence of water motion, no two species were able to coexist, while under the hypothetical conditions of advection without turbulence (laminar flow), just two species were able to occur contemporaneously. Coexistence of all three species was achieved only with the addition of a random turbulent component to the model's hydrodynamic function. Moreover, this general coexistence was observed only when the major turbulent frequency approached the turnover rate of phytoplankton populations. We suggest that there is a limited region of periodicities and magnitudes for hydrodynamic energy in which phytoplankton can coexist, and that most natural aquatic environments fall within this region. We further speculate that, in general, the coupling of physical and biological processes in nature may be influenced by the relative frequency characteristics of those processes.},

Singular-spectrum analysis (SSA) and the multi-taper method (MTM) of spectral analysis revealed a nonlinear trend and quasi-periodic oscillations. Analysis of the linearly detrended series showed significant frequencies ranging from quasi biennial to {\textgreater}100 years. The interannual and interdecadal signals detected are within the range of periodicity of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) modes of variability. A smoothing procedure was used to separate low frequencies, or trend, and higher frequencies. Four reconstructed components of the low-pass-filtered time series were sufficient to explain 95\% of the filtered series variance. The reconstruction showed signals with periods longer than 20 years that could be associated with the PDO. The series showed a relatively constant trend between approximately 1895 and 1965, and a steep declining trend in the last 40 years. Twenty four reconstructed components of the high-frequency residuals were required to explain 90\% of the variance in the residual series. The reconstruction showed interdecadal signals that could be associated with the PDO and signals with periods between two and seven years that could be associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Results of a coherence analysis showed that ice-cover duration is significantly correlated with the PDO for periods longer than about 20 years, and with the SOI for periods between two and seven years. The results suggest a relationship between the decreasing ice duration since about 1970 and the accompanying increase in Northern Hemisphere mean annual surface temperature. This interpretation agrees with previous descriptions of observed historic changes that appear to be related to anthropogenic activity.},

In eutrophic stratified lakes, seasonal entrainment can be responsible for delayed recovery following a decrease in external phosphorus load. We compared seasonal estimates of entrainment derived from single- and multilocation thermocline migration approaches. Entrainment estimates from these methods were similar. A sampling approach based on a single centralized location produced whole-lake entrainment estimates in general agreement with the mean value from the multilocation approach (the single-location approach reasonably reproduced patterns at a weekly and seasonal time scale). In this study, it was not essential to account for spatial variation in estimating annual rates of entrainment. We also estimated entrainment based on a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic model over a short period of significant thermocline migration. The 3-D model was most useful in exposing spatial and temporal variation in temperature and phosphorus profiles that are otherwise difficult to observe. Spatial variation in phosphorus profiles was associated with upwelling of metalimnetic water represented by the 3-D model. These transient dynamics, though a relatively small portion of an annual phosphorus budget, may supply nutrients to epilimnetic phytoplankton during periods of nutrient limitation. There is a need for further research that combines 3-D hydrodynamic modeling with field collection of biological and chemical data.},

Ice duration has shortened and the ice-off date has become earlier for Lake Mendota from 1905 to 2000 as air temperatures have warmed and snowfall has increased. In addition, the ice record has cyclic components at inter-annual and inter-decadal scales. We examined the frequency domain relations between ice, local climate and the teleconnections, Southern Ocean Oscillation (SOI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Northern Pacific Index (NP), through a three-tiered analysis of coherence. The coherence results provide evidence of linear relations between the three levels at inter-annual and inter-decadal frequencies. Of the three local climate variables analyzed, namely temperature, snowfall and snow depth, temperature is the variable that most significantly affects ice duration and ice-off date, at both inter-annual and inter-decadal frequencies. The most significant effect of teleconnections on local climate are the effects of PDO on snowfall and snow depth, and SOI on temperature, at inter-annual frequencies, and the effect of NAO on snowfall at inter-decadal frequencies. The teleconnections that most significantly affect ice-cover duration and ice-off date, particularly at inter-decadal frequencies, are the PDO and the NAO. The influence of PDO on ice-cover appears to be transmitted through temperature, while the influence of the NAO appears to be transmitted through temperature and snowfall. A cascading set of links between teleconnections, local climate, and lake ice explain some, but not all, of the dynamics in these time series.},

High-frequency in situ automated sensor data and long-term manual observational data from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, were used to parameterize, calibrate, and evaluate model predictions. We focused specifically on short-term predictions of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and phytoplankton biomass over one season. Traditional goodness-of-fit metrics indicated more accurate prediction of physics than chemical or biological variables in the time domain. This was confirmed by wavelet analysis in both the time and frequency domains. For temperature, predicted and observed global wavelet spectra were closely related, while observed dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence spectral characteristics were not reproduced by the model for key time scales, indicating that processes not modeled may be important drivers of the observed signal. Although the magnitude and timing of physical and biological changes were simulated adequately at the seasonal time scale through calibration, time scale-specific dynamics, for example short-term cycles, were difficult to reproduce, and were relatively insensitive to the effects of varying parameters. The use of wavelet analysis is novel to aquatic ecosystem modeling, is complementary to traditional goodness-of-fit metrics, and allows for assessment of variability at specific temporal scales. In this way, the effect of processes operating at distinct temporal scales can be isolated and better understood, both in situ and in silico. Wavelet transforms are particularly well suited for assessment of temporal and spatial heterogeneity when coupled to high-frequency data from automated in situ or remote sensing platforms.},

Water quality management continues to focus on aggregated metrics, such as chlorophyll and total nutrients, which may not be sufficient to explain complex community changes and functions such as toxin production. For example, nitrogen (N) speciation and cycling play an important role, on daily time scales, in shaping cyanobacterial communities because declining N has been shown to select for N fixers. In addition, subsequent N pulses from N2 fixation may stimulate and sustain toxic cyanobacterial growth. Herein, we describe how rapid early summer declines in N followed by bursts of N fixation have shaped cyanobacterial communities in a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA), possibly driving toxic Microcystis blooms throughout the growing season. On weekly time scales in 2010 and 2011, we monitored the cyanobacterial community in a eutrophic lake using the phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) region to determine population dynamics. In parallel, we measured microcystin concentrations, N2 fixation rates, and potential environmental drivers that contribute to structuring the community. In both years, cyanobacterial community change was strongly correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations, and Aphanizomenon and Microcystis alternated dominance throughout the pre-toxic, toxic, and posttoxic phases of the lake. Microcystin concentrations increased a few days after the first significant N2 fixation rates were observed. Then, following large early summer N2 fixation events, Microcystis increased and became most abundant. Maximum microcystin concentrations coincided with Microcystis dominance. In both years, DIN concentrations dropped again in late summer, and N2 fixation rates and Aphanizomenon abundance increased before the lake mixed in the fall. Estimated N inputs from N2 fixation were large enough to supplement, or even support, the toxic Microcystis blooms.},

Observations show that Lake Mendota has experienced significant changes in ice cover: later ice-on date(9.0 days later per century), earlier ice-off date (12.3 days per century), decreasing ice cover duration (21.3 days per century), while model simulations indicate a change in maximum ice thickness (12.7{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}cm decrease per century). Model simulations also show changes in the lake thermal regime of earlier stratification onset (12.3 days per century), later fall turnover (14.6 days per century), longer stratification duration (26.8 days per century), and decreasing summer hypolimnetic temperatures (−1.4{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}°C per century). Correlation analysis of lake variables and driving variables revealed ice cover variables, stratification onset, epilimnetic temperature, and hypolimnetic temperature were most closely correlated with air temperature, whereas freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic heating, and fall turnover date were more closely correlated with wind speed. Each lake variable (i.e., ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, maximum ice thickness, freeze-over water temperature, stratification onset, fall turnover date, stratification duration, epilimnion temperature, hypolimnion temperature, and hypolimnetic heating) was averaged for the three periods (1911–1980, 1981–1993, and 1994–2014) delineated by abrupt changes in air temperature and wind speed. Average summer hypolimnetic temperature and fall turnover date exhibit significant differences between the third period and the first two periods. Changes in ice cover (ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, and maximum ice thickness) exhibit an abrupt change after 1994, which was related in part to the warm El Niño winter of 1997–1998. Under-ice water temperature, freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic temperature, fall turnover date, and stratification duration demonstrate a significant difference in the third period (1994–2014), when air temperature was warmest and wind speeds decreased rather abruptly. The trends in ice cover and water temperature demonstrate responses to both long-term and abrupt changes in meteorological conditions that can be complemented with numerical modeling to better understand how these variables will respond in a future climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cultural eutrophication of lakes due to excess loading of nutrients is a global problem affecting the provisioning of freshwater ecosystem services. Lake water quality is often described by trophic state indicators such as water clarity or concentrations of nutrients, chlorophyll, and cyanobacteria toxins. While these indicators are widely assumed to covary, capturing the same basic aspects of water quality, they can be uncoupled by changes in lake food webs. Outbreak of the invasive predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes longimanus, in Lakes Mendota and Monona, Wisconsin (U.S.A.) in 2009 led to a decline in the herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, and in turn, water clarity. We use 20-yr datasets for Lakes Mendota and Monona to evaluate interactions among nutrients, zooplankton, and phytoplankton that resulted in this trophic cascade. After invasion, diatoms increased in both lakes resulting in reduced water clarity, whereas cyanobacteria did not change in either lake. Multivariate time series analysis revealed that D. pulicaria grazing controlled edible diatoms in both lakes. Cyanobacteria biomass was positively associated with both D. pulicaria and summer nutrient concentrations. These results further clarify the limitations of top-down control in eutrophic lakes: grazing by zooplankton can control edible phytoplankton taxa, but largely inedible cyanobacteria may be more limited by nutrient concentrations. Accordingly, despite declining clarity in Lake Mendota, the number of beach closures due to cyanobacteria blooms declined following Bythotrephes invasion. Our study reveals how these two indicators of water quality—water clarity and cyanobacteria blooms—can become uncoupled during a food web shift.},

We hypothesized that differences in thermal structure, nutrients, and meteorology drive interannual variability in CCC and abundance. Cluster analysis differentiated dominant cyanobacteria into rare, low abundance, or sporadically occurring taxa. The bloom-forming genera were Microcystis and Aphanizomenon, accounting for {\textasciitilde} 70\% of total cyanobacterial biovolume (BV) on average, whereas unusually high abundance of Planktothrix, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria were clear outliers in three of the years. Variability in CCC was significantly correlated (P {\textless} 0.05, R {\textgreater} 0.3) with ice duration, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and spring nitrite + nitrate (NO2+3); ice duration and TKN were associated with the occurrence of primarily non-bloom-forming genera. Pairwise correlations tested linear, exponential, and polynomial correlates of absolute and relative total Cyanophyta, Microcystis, or Aphanizomenon BV. TKN, total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP), TN:TP ratio, Schmidt stability, and rainfall correlated with total Cyanophyta, Microcystis, and Aphanizomenon BV, whereas ice cover, NO2+3, and TKN correlated with relative Microcystis and Aphanizomenon BV. Despite increasing TN:TP ratio over two decades, cyanobacterial abundance had not changed significantly. These data suggest differing responses of cyanobacterial genera to important environmental factors over two decades.},

	abstract = {Human impacts on freshwater ecosystems are pervasive, but the short and discontinuous nature of most datasets limits our ability to understand the controls on water quality and effectively manage freshwater resources. We examine change in Lake Mendota (Madison, Wisconsin) over the last two centuries by pairing analyses of a sedimentary archive with the site’s {\textgreater} 100 yr limnological record. We show that eutrophication of the lake, evident as an abrupt shift in sediment composition, began in the late 19th century following the intensiﬁcation of urban and agricultural land use in the watershed. Efforts to address deterioration of lake water quality, including the removal of point-source pollutants and biomanipulation, have had a measurable inﬂuence on sediment composition and water clarity. Since the early 1980s, quasi-seasonal cycles of phytoplankton blooms have induced calcite precipitation, leaving distinct laminations in the sedimentary record. These “whiting events” evidently did not accumulate in lake sediments until the late 20th century, indicating that efforts to remediate water quality have shifted the lake to a new ecosystem state. Calcite whitings can improve water quality in eutrophic lakes by coprecipitation with phosphate, increasing phosphorus (P) burial in lake sediments. Using long-term limnological records, we report negative correlations between calcite saturation indices and P in lake surface waters and show that calcite whitings could partially explain recent P decline in Lake Mendota surface waters. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized potential control on water quality in this eutrophic lake and demonstrates the beneﬁt of coupling long-term limnological data with sedimentary records.},

	abstract = {Cisco (Coregonus artedi) are an important indicator species for cold-water lake habitats in the Great Lakes region, and many populations have been extirpated at their southern range limit over the last century. Understanding the roles of climate and water quality in these extirpations should inform protection of cold-water fishes. Using the water temperature at the depth where dissolved oxygen falls to 3 mg L−1 (TDO3) as a metric, we investigated the roles of climate and water quality as drivers of habitat availability for cisco in Lake Mendota, WI, USA from 1976 to 2013. We find that summer (Jun−Aug) air temperatures, spring (Mar−May) phosphorus load, and spring inflow influence summer TDO3. Warm air temperatures lead to the greatest increases in TDO3, whereas reduced phosphorus loads can reduce TDO3, thus alleviating oxythermal stress. Under air temperatures expected under the A1B climate change scenario, a 25\% reduction in phosphorus load would stabilize TDO3 at current levels, while a 75\% reduction in phosphorus loading would be required to expand oxythermal habitat. Costs of these reductions are estimated to range from US\$16.9 million (−25\%) to US\$155–167 million (−75\%) over a 20-year period but may be feasible by expanding upon current watershed phosphorus reduction initiatives if sustained funding were available. Identifying targeted reductions will become increasingly important throughout the region as warmer temperatures and longer stratification reduces cool- and cold-water fish habitat in many Midwestern lakes under the expected future climate.},

	abstract = {Elucidating patterns and mechanisms that shape phytoplankton assemblages is a popular area of research for empirical and theoretical ecologists. Despite the daunting complexity of phytoplankton dynamics, much of our current understanding has been based on simple models describing food-web interactions with few differential equations. Skeptical views in the literature raise concerns about the increasing model complexity and advice to seek parsimony rather than simplicity. To address this controversy (simple versus complex models), we propose the introduction of an extra layer of causality into plankton models by connecting algal processes (maximum growth rates, nutrient kinetics, settling velocities, metabolic rates) with species-specific morphological features (cell volume, surface-to-volume ratio, shape). In this study, we demonstrate the capacity of a size-based plankton model to reproduce observed water quality patterns (phosphate, total phosphorus, nitrate, total ammonia, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and total zooplankton biomass) in the Hamilton Harbour, Ontario. Consistent with empirical evidence, our modeling analysis showed that small algal species have a distinct competitive advantage in summer epilimnetic environments across the range of cell volume and nutrient loading conditions examined; especially, when they are characterized by higher optimal temperature for growth. Strong top-down pressure mediated by high zooplankton abundance effectively controls the standing biomass of phytoplankton species that can otherwise realize high growth rates under the conditions typically prevailing in the end-of-summer epilimnetic environments (e.g., higher temperature optima, higher tolerance in low water clarity). Under high zooplankton control, the secondary variations of phytoplankton are modulated by the ambient phosphorus levels and the size-based strategies for resources procurement, such as the regulation of nutrient transport kinetics. By contrast, when the summer algal assemblage is released by the zooplankton grazing, the exceedance of critical phytoplankton biomass levels and the likelihood of harmful algal blooms are determined by the multitude of factors that shape inter-specific competition patterns (e.g., relative abundance of competing species, nutrient uptake kinetics). Our study evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and identifies future directions that would provide operational models founded upon concepts of allometry.},

	abstract = {One of the founding principles of modern aquatic ecology is that human-induced perturbations in the autotroph-herbivore interface have the potential to affect ecological processes at higher trophic levels. Thus, zooplankton’s physiological state can be an early warning sign of broader impairments of aquatic ecosystems. Based on this reasoning, the micro-crustacean Daphnia is often identified as a keystone freshwater species, but its bioenergetic motivations and physiological priorities remain only partially understood. Using a bioenergetically explicit ecophysiological approach, we model how trade-offs in resource allocation can shape a daphnid's growth. Our multi-faceted hierarchical approach to metabolite utilization challenges the popular paradigm of elemental stoichiometry being the primary regulatory factor of algal food quality. We examine the post-gut bioenergetic ramifications of an unbalanced diet, showing that animal growth can be significantly compromised by the elevated energetic requirements of homeostasis. Our modeling framework offers an excellent stepping-stone to connect zooplankton physiological processes with the signals of external stressors, and subsequently evaluate the patterns of mass and energy flow at an ecosystem scale. The proposed microscopic-to-macroscopic strategy will likely offer a new prospect towards the development of early warning systems for the management of freshwater resources.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional water quality model (DYRESM Water Quality) is described which combines a process based hydrodynamic model (DYRESM) with numerical descriptions of phytoplankton production, nutrient cycling, the oxygen budget and particle dynamics. The hydrodynamic component is free from calibration, which ensures that it is readily transferable to other lakes and reservoirs. This improves water quality predictions derived for different hydrodynamic forcing events. It also allows for identification of the specific hydrodynamic processes that influence water quality. The water quality component consists of 13 state variables which may include up to three algal groups, BOD, dissolved oxygen and four components of the dissolved oxygen budget (inflows, biochemical processes, surface aeration and oxygen present in the reservoir at the start of a simulation), nutrients (PO4P, NO3N, NH4N, TP and TN) and inorganic particles. The particle model simulates settling and flocculation/deflocculation of up to seven different size classes of particles. The hydrodynamic, water quality and particle models interact on a sub-daily time step. Forcing data for the model are entered as daily-averaged values. The ecological component requires calibration for each new application through adjustment of several different biological and chemical parameters. Literature ranges for these parameters are wide, but provided the process description is correct, many of the parameters can be validated with measured data.},

High-frequency in situ automated sensor data and long-term manual observational data from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, were used to parameterize, calibrate, and evaluate model predictions. We focused specifically on short-term predictions of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and phytoplankton biomass over one season. Traditional goodness-of-fit metrics indicated more accurate prediction of physics than chemical or biological variables in the time domain. This was confirmed by wavelet analysis in both the time and frequency domains. For temperature, predicted and observed global wavelet spectra were closely related, while observed dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence spectral characteristics were not reproduced by the model for key time scales, indicating that processes not modeled may be important drivers of the observed signal. Although the magnitude and timing of physical and biological changes were simulated adequately at the seasonal time scale through calibration, time scale-specific dynamics, for example short-term cycles, were difficult to reproduce, and were relatively insensitive to the effects of varying parameters. The use of wavelet analysis is novel to aquatic ecosystem modeling, is complementary to traditional goodness-of-fit metrics, and allows for assessment of variability at specific temporal scales. In this way, the effect of processes operating at distinct temporal scales can be isolated and better understood, both in situ and in silico. Wavelet transforms are particularly well suited for assessment of temporal and spatial heterogeneity when coupled to high-frequency data from automated in situ or remote sensing platforms.},

We estimated how nutrient management programs and legislation have affected the budget by comparing the budget for 2007 to a budget calculated for 1995, prior to implementation of the programs. Since 1995, inputs decreased from 1,310,000 to 853,000 kg P/yr (35\% reduction) and accumulation decreased from 575,000 to 279,000 kg P/yr (51\% reduction). Changes in P input and accumulation were attributed primarily to enhanced agricultural nutrient management, reduction in dairy cattle feed supplements and an urban P fertilizer ban. Four scenarios were investigated to determine potential impacts of additional nutrient management tactics on the watershed P budget and P loading to Lake Mendota. Elimination of chemical P fertilizer input has the greatest potential to reduce watershed P accumulation and establishment of riparian buffers has the greatest potential to prevent P loading to Lake Mendota.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the issues related to the use of validation in hydrological model calibration. Traditionally, models are calibrated and then assessed on an independent period (split-sample) to determine their adequacy in simulating streamflow as compared to observations. In this study, two hydrological models and three North American catchments are used to evaluate the effects of using validation to assess the model parameters’ robustness on the model’s actual simulation capabilities and accuracy in simulating streamflow. The length of the calibration period is increased from 1 to 16 years, and for each case a large number of randomly selected combinations of years are used for calibration and for validation using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency metric. The calibrated model is then run on an independent 8-year test-period to assess the model’s actual performance in simulation mode in unknown conditions. The process is bootstrapped 30 times to ensure the robustness of the results. The tests pit the calibration/validation methods on increasing calibration period lengths against a full calibration on the entire available dataset. Results show that the calibration on the full dataset is the optimal strategy as it generates the most robust parameter sets, provides the best model accuracy on an independent testing period and does not require assumption-making on the modeler’s part. The calibrated parameter sets for each test-case were evaluated using the relative bias and correlation metrics, which revealed that the method transfers well to these two other metrics. Results also demonstrate the pitfalls of the commonly used split-sampling strategy, where good parameter sets may be discarded due to model performance discrepancies between calibration and validation periods. The conclusions point to the need to use as many years as possible in the calibration step and to entirely disregard the validation aspect under certain conditions.},

	abstract = {Cisco (Coregonus artedi) are an important indicator species for cold-water lake habitats in the Great Lakes region, and many populations have been extirpated at their southern range limit over the last century. Understanding the roles of climate and water quality in these extirpations should inform protection of cold-water fishes. Using the water temperature at the depth where dissolved oxygen falls to 3 mg L−1 (TDO3) as a metric, we investigated the roles of climate and water quality as drivers of habitat availability for cisco in Lake Mendota, WI, USA from 1976 to 2013. We find that summer (Jun−Aug) air temperatures, spring (Mar−May) phosphorus load, and spring inflow influence summer TDO3. Warm air temperatures lead to the greatest increases in TDO3, whereas reduced phosphorus loads can reduce TDO3, thus alleviating oxythermal stress. Under air temperatures expected under the A1B climate change scenario, a 25\% reduction in phosphorus load would stabilize TDO3 at current levels, while a 75\% reduction in phosphorus loading would be required to expand oxythermal habitat. Costs of these reductions are estimated to range from US\$16.9 million (−25\%) to US\$155–167 million (−75\%) over a 20-year period but may be feasible by expanding upon current watershed phosphorus reduction initiatives if sustained funding were available. Identifying targeted reductions will become increasingly important throughout the region as warmer temperatures and longer stratification reduces cool- and cold-water fish habitat in many Midwestern lakes under the expected future climate.},

The seven model parameters were parameterized by using official monitoring data and the satellite temperature data of the data set LakeSST for French water bodies. The performance of the parameterised model was compared to that of two widely used models (FLake and air2water with four parameters). The model showed a good performance in the simulation of epilimnion temperatures, especially in the summer. For hypolimnion temperatures the performance was worse, but still comparable to that of other models. Because of its good performance and the few data needed to run the model, it is a good choice for managers interested in the thermal behaviour of inland water bodies.},

The strength of stratification substantially influences the transport of water parcels from the surface to the bottom of a lake. In recent years, the stratification in Lake Biwa—the largest freshwater lake in Japan—has been stronger. However, it is difficult to reproduce the stratification well in the simulations. In the present study, we built a hydrodynamic model for the purpose of analyzing the structure of the stratification in detail. Using the model, we evaluated the reproducibility of the seasonal and annual changes of vertical water distribution and flow field in Lake Biwa from 2007 to 2011. The hydrodynamic model results show that the vertical water distribution approximately agrees with the field observations based on the statistical analysis. The seasonal change of thermal stratification is reasonably reproduced by the hydrodynamic model simulations. In the simulation, there are mainly two circulation flows at the surface layer of the lake. The first flows anticlockwise and the second flows clockwise in the northern part of Lake Biwa. In order to compensate for the surface water flow, the water under the thermocline sometimes flows in the opposite direction under each circulation flow.},

Several episodes of density current intrusions are documented. Water temperatures and salinities measured near the bottom of a 10 m deep Minneapolis lake during the late winter warming periods in 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1995 show significant rapid changes which are correlated with observed higher air temperatures and snowmelt runoff. The snowmelt runoff entering this particular lake (Ryan Lake) has increased electrical conductivity, salinity, and density. The source of the salinity is the salt spread on urban streets in the winter. Heating of littoral waters in spring may also contribute to the occurrence of the sinking flows, but is clearly not the only cause.},

The main result is that Z ∼ E−1/3B1/3/N. It is shown that the depth of the intrusion scales as Z ∼ (3 ± 1)B1/3/N for laboratory experiments, and as  for oceanic density currents. The velocity of a large-scale density current is controlled by a geostrophic balance defined as Ugeo = 0.25g′s/f, where s is the slope and f is the Coriolis parameter. The geostrophic buoyancy flux is then defined by Bgeo = g′Ugeoh, with g′ the reduced gravity and h the thickness of the current. The scaling  herein implies that the depth of an oceanic intrusion is relatively insensitive to changes in source water properties but is very sensitive to changes in the stratification of the water column, consistent with the previous scaling of Price and Baringer. For example, if the buoyancy flux of a dense current were to double while the stratification remained constant, then there would only be a 25\% increase in the intrusion depth, whereas doubling the stratification would result in a 50\% decrease of the intrusion depth.},

High-resolution temperature proﬁles were taken within the upper sediment, accompanied by temperature and oxygen measurements within the overlying water. Heat transport in the upper sediment alternated between diffusion and convection at the periodicity of the internal seiches, with the strongest oscillations at a period of 2.4 h. During long-duration events (O30 min) of seiche-driven cooling of the sediment surface, the thermal instability extended as much as 9 cm down into the sediment, followed by free convective transport in the upper sediment. The vertical convective heat ﬂuxes were close to those of Rayleigh–Be´nard convection for pure ﬂuid ﬂow. The convective heat ﬂuxes were, on average, three times higher than the diffusive heat ﬂuxes, and the maximum convective heat ﬂuxes of 50–100 W m–2 were 10–20 times higher than the maximum diffusive heat ﬂuxes. Internal seiches caused advective oxygen ﬂuctuations above the sediment that can potentially reinforce the effect of convection on biochemical processes within the lake sediments. Periodic temperature and oxygen variations due to internal seiching can cover w10\% of the sediment area, depending on seasonal stratiﬁcation and lake morphometry. In these areas, convection intensiﬁes the transport of heat, nutrients, and oxygen through the sediment surface and represents an important feature of the ecology of lakes.},

	abstract = {Despite providing water-related services as the primary purpose of urban water system (UWS), all relevant activities require capital investments and operational expenditures, consume resources (e.g. materials and chemicals), and may increase negative environmental impacts (e.g. contaminant discharge, emissions to water and air). Performance assessment of such a metabolic system may require developing a holistic approach which encompasses various system elements and criteria. This paper analyses the impact of integration of UWS components on the metabolism based performance assessment for future planning using a number of intervention strategies. It also explores the importance of sustainability based criteria in the assessment of long-term planning. Two assessment approaches analysed here are: (1) planning for only water supply system (WSS) as a part of the UWS and (2) planning for an integrated UWS including potable water, stormwater, wastewater and water recycling. WaterMet2 model is used to simulate metabolic type processes in the UWS and calculate quantitative performance indicators. The analysis is demonstrated on the problem of strategic level planning of a real-world UWS to where optional intervention strategies are applied. The resulting performance is assessed using the multiple criteria of both conventional and sustainability type; and optional intervention strategies are then ranked using the Compromise Programming method. The results obtained show that the high ranked intervention strategies in the integrated UWS are those supporting both water supply and stormwater/wastewater subsystems (e.g. rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling schemes) whilst these strategies are ranked low in the WSS and those targeting improvement of water supply components only (e.g. rehabilitation of clean water pipes and addition of new water resources) are preferred instead. Results also demonstrate that both conventional and sustainability type performance indicators are necessary for strategic planning in the UWS.},

	abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is increasingly used to study a wide variety of complex Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM) processes, such as water ﬂow and turbulent mixing of contaminants in rivers and estuaries and wind ﬂow and air pollution dispersion in urban areas. However, the accuracy and reliability of CFD modeling and the correct use of CFD results can easily be compromised. In 2006, Jakeman et al. set out ten iterative steps of good disciplined model practice to develop purposeful, credible models from data and a priori knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision (Jakeman et al., 2006). This paper discusses the application of the ten-steps approach to CFD for EFM in three parts. In the ﬁrst part, the existing best practice guidelines for CFD applications in this area are reviewed and positioned in the ten-steps framework. The second and third part present a retrospective analysis of two case studies in the light of the ten-steps approach: (1) contaminant dispersion due to transverse turbulent mixing in a shallow water ﬂow and (2) coupled urban wind ﬂow and indoor natural ventilation of the Amsterdam ArenA football stadium. It is shown that the existing best practice guidelines for CFD mainly focus on the last steps in the ten-steps framework. The reasons for this focus are outlined and the value of the additional e preceding e steps is discussed. The retrospective analysis of the case studies indicates that the ten-steps approach is very well applicable to CFD for EFM and that it provides a comprehensive framework that encompasses and extends the existing best practice guidelines.},

	abstract = {The aim was to disclose the seasonality in the internal seiches during summer stratification in 2010 within the small, 3 km long, ellipse-shaped, temperate Lake Arendsee (Germany) with simple morphometry. We used observations of temperatures from two thermistor chains (09 April to 24 September), conductivity and temperature profiles, and wind speeds and directions (January to December). To analyze the seasonality in the periods, appearance and modal structure of the seiches, and the wind forcing, we applied spectral analysis on monthly time series of isotherms and wind speeds, and wavelet analysis on 6 month long time series of integrated potential energy and wind speeds. To determine the effect of earth’s rotation on seiches, we applied two analytical models based on three-layer density stratification. Earth’s rotation affected internal seiches significantly even in a small lake. That was shown by the models and the Burger number being , 1 during stratification. Vertical mode 1 Kelvin-type seiches dominated the internal seiche weather in Lake Arendsee, with their periods changing because of seasonal variations in stratification. Weak, free seiches of vertical mode 2 were amplified during three episodes: (1) in midsummer, when their periods coincided with the inertial period at the lake’s latitude, (2) in late spring, and (3) in autumn, both when their periods approached 24 h. The amplifications were caused by resonance between free seiches and wind-forced oscillations at diurnal and inertial periods. Such short-term resonance events, associated with enhanced mixing, are inherent for the seasonal stratification cycle in the most temperate lakes.},

	abstract = {The aim was to disclose the seasonality in the internal seiches during summer stratification in 2010 within the small, 3 km long, ellipse-shaped, temperate Lake Arendsee (Germany) with simple morphometry. We used observations of temperatures from two thermistor chains (09 April to 24 September), conductivity and temperature profiles, and wind speeds and directions (January to December). To analyze the seasonality in the periods, appearance and modal structure of the seiches, and the wind forcing, we applied spectral analysis on monthly time series of isotherms and wind speeds, and wavelet analysis on 6 month long time series of integrated potential energy and wind speeds. To determine the effect of earth’s rotation on seiches, we applied two analytical models based on three-layer density stratification. Earth’s rotation affected internal seiches significantly even in a small lake. That was shown by the models and the Burger number being , 1 during stratification. Vertical mode 1 Kelvin-type seiches dominated the internal seiche weather in Lake Arendsee, with their periods changing because of seasonal variations in stratification. Weak, free seiches of vertical mode 2 were amplified during three episodes: (1) in midsummer, when their periods coincided with the inertial period at the lake’s latitude, (2) in late spring, and (3) in autumn, both when their periods approached 24 h. The amplifications were caused by resonance between free seiches and wind-forced oscillations at diurnal and inertial periods. Such short-term resonance events, associated with enhanced mixing, are inherent for the seasonal stratification cycle in the most temperate lakes.},

	abstract = {Despite providing water-related services as the primary purpose of urban water system (UWS), all relevant activities require capital investments and operational expenditures, consume resources (e.g. materials and chemicals), and may increase negative environmental impacts (e.g. contaminant discharge, emissions to water and air). Performance assessment of such a metabolic system may require developing a holistic approach which encompasses various system elements and criteria. This paper analyses the impact of integration of UWS components on the metabolism based performance assessment for future planning using a number of intervention strategies. It also explores the importance of sustainability based criteria in the assessment of long-term planning. Two assessment approaches analysed here are: (1) planning for only water supply system (WSS) as a part of the UWS and (2) planning for an integrated UWS including potable water, stormwater, wastewater and water recycling. WaterMet2 model is used to simulate metabolic type processes in the UWS and calculate quantitative performance indicators. The analysis is demonstrated on the problem of strategic level planning of a real-world UWS to where optional intervention strategies are applied. The resulting performance is assessed using the multiple criteria of both conventional and sustainability type; and optional intervention strategies are then ranked using the Compromise Programming method. The results obtained show that the high ranked intervention strategies in the integrated UWS are those supporting both water supply and stormwater/wastewater subsystems (e.g. rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling schemes) whilst these strategies are ranked low in the WSS and those targeting improvement of water supply components only (e.g. rehabilitation of clean water pipes and addition of new water resources) are preferred instead. Results also demonstrate that both conventional and sustainability type performance indicators are necessary for strategic planning in the UWS.},

It is also desirable, in order to simplify theoretical analysis, that the parameters in production equations be chosen so as to minimize the range of values needed to describe the variation of photosynthesis in nature. This can be achieved by choosing the quantum yield of photosynthesis in weak light as parameter instead of the maximum rate in saturating light. In lakes, the value of the quantum yield in weak light is likely to be about 0.06 moles carbon per einstein absorbed. An additional advantage of the transformed equations is to make evident a simple relation between actual daily production and the upper limit to production.},

Speciﬁcally we looked at the cycling of S (sulfate, dissolved and particulate sulﬁde e the latter measured as acid volatile sulﬁde; AVS), C (carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, methane and the short chain volatile fatty acids formate, acetate, butyrate and propionate), N (dinitrogen, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite) and redox active metals (Fe(II) and Mn(II)). Sulfate had the largest effects on the cycling of S and C. All the added S at lower loadings were converted to AVS over the course of the experiment (30 days). At the highest loading (8 mmol) less than 50\% of consumed S was converted to AVS, however this is believed to be a kinetic effect. Although sulfate reduction was occurring in sediments with added sulfate, dissolved sulﬁde concentrations remained low throughout the study. Sulfate addition affected methanogenesis. In the absence of added carbon, addition of sulfate, even at a loading of 1 mmol, resulted in a halving of methane formation. The initial rate of formation of methane was not affected by sulfate if additional carbon was added to the sediment. However, there was evidence for anaerobic methane oxidation in those sediments with added sulfate and carbon, but not in those sediments treated only with carbon. Surprisingly, sulfate addition had little apparent impact on N dynamics; previous studies have shown that sulﬁde can inhibit denitriﬁcation and stimulate dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia. We propose that because most of the reduced sulfur was in particulate form, levels of dissolved sulﬁde were too low to interfere with the N cycle.},

	abstract = {Realistic modelling of marine ecosystems is necessary for improving our understanding of the ocean’s biogeochemical state and for predicting their response to anthropic perturbations. An essential step in achieving this task is the use of mechanistic formulations to describe the biogeochemical processes involved in the dynamics of marine pelagic ecosystems. This study provides a review on some modelling strategies for some of the key processes involved in the dynamics of phytoplankton. It encompasses the most advanced work in terms of mechanistic understanding and, therefore, mainly deals with photosynthesis (including photoacclimation and photoinhibition), respiration, and nutrient uptake (including multilimitation of algal growth by nutrients). We highlight, that in many ecosystem models, phytoplankton processes are still described more or less empirically, mainly due to a lack of biochemical knowledge, or if a mechanistic formulation exists, the parameters are often diﬃcult to assess experimentally. As a result of this investigation, a preliminary structure for a generic phytoplankton model is delivered in the last section of this paper. This model includes a mechanistic representation of photosynthesis/photoinhibition based on photosystem II status, as well as new formulations for photoacclimation and dissolved organic matter exudation processes. The model sensitivity analysis with regard to its parameters and a comparison with chemostat experimental data are presented in a companion paper [Baklouti, M., Faure, V., Pawlowski, L., Sciandra, A., 2006. Investigation and sensitivity analysis of a mechanistic phytoplankton model implemented in a new modular numerical tool (Eco3M) dedicated to biogeochemical modelling. Progress in Oceanography]. Finally, this new class of multi-element, multi-species phytoplankton models will provide the basis for future studies on ecosystem modelling.},

It is the default class of models implemented in our new numerical tool Eco3M, which is dedicated to Ecological, Mechanistic and Modular Modelling. A brief overview of its main features is given in Section 2 of the present paper. In the next sections, a particular phytoplankton model among the aforementioned class has been tested with special emphasis on the mechanistic photosynthesis component relating the photosynthetic rate to the proportion of open photosystems II. The present study encompasses several essential steps that are inherent to any modelling, including model reduction, model sensitivity analysis and comparison of model outputs with experiments. The global sensitivity analysis of the plankton model for one-at-a-time parameter perturbations revealed a restricted set of parameters having major inﬂuence on the model outputs. Sensitivity tests involving simultaneous parameter perturbations within the range actually encountered in the literature provided a conﬁdence interval for the outputs. Chemostat experiments performed on nitrate-limited diatoms grown under low (LL) and high-light (HL) conditions have been used for comparison with model outputs. The good ﬁt between measured data and model outputs using the same parameter values in both the LL and HL cases demonstrates the ability of our model to represent the main features of phytoplankton dynamics including photoacclimation. Finally, Eco3M is ultimately intended to include explicit bacterial and zooplankton compartments, as well as to be coupled with ocean circulation models, but the intrinsic behavior of the phytoplankton model has been investigated ﬁrst, independently of physical forcing.},

	abstract = {Microplastics represent an increasing source of anthropogenic contamination in aquatic environments, where they may also act as scavengers and transporters of persistent organic pollutants. As estuaries are amongst the most productive aquatic systems, it is important to understand sorption behaviour and transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by microplastics along estuarine gradients. The effects of salinity sorption equilibrium kinetics on the distribution coefﬁcients (Kd) of phenanthrene (Phe) and 4,40-DDT, onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and onto polyethylene (PE) were therefore investigated. A salinity gradient representing freshwater, estuarine and marine conditions, with salinities corresponding to 0 (MilliQ water, 690 mS/cm), 8.8, 17.5, 26.3 and 35 was used. Salinity had no signiﬁcant effect on the time required to reach equilibrium onto PVC or PE and neither did it affect desorption rates of contaminants from plastics. Although salinity had no effect on sorption capacity of Phe onto plastics, a slight decrease in sorption capacity was observed for DDT with salinity. Salinity had little effect on sorption behaviour and POP/plastic combination was shown to be a more important factor. Transport of Phe and DDT from riverine to brackish and marine waters by plastic is therefore likely to be much more dependent on the aqueous POP concentration than on salinity. The physical characteristics of the polymer and local environmental conditions (e.g. plastic density, particle residence time in estuaries) will affect the physical transport of contaminated plastics. A transport model of POPs by microplastics under estuarine conditions is proposed. Transport of Phe and DDT by PVC and PE from fresh and brackish water toward fully marine conditions was the most likely net direction for contaminant transport and followed the order: Phe-PE {\textgreater}{\textgreater} DDT-PVC ¼ DDT-PE {\textgreater}{\textgreater} Phe-PVC.},

We investigated the potential for polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) to sorb and desorb 14C-DDT, 14C-phenanthrene (Phe), 14Cperﬂuorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and 14C-di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Desorption rates of POPs were quantiﬁed in seawater and under simulated gut conditions. Inﬂuence of pH and temperature was examined in order to represent cold and warm blooded organisms. Desorption rates were faster with gut surfactant, with a further substantial increase under conditions simulating warm blooded organisms. Desorption under gut conditions could be up to 30 times greater than in seawater alone. Of the POP/ plastic combinations examined Phe with PE gave the highest potential for transport to organisms.},

	abstract = {The fate of iron (Fe) may aﬀect that of phosphorus (P) and arsenic (As) in natural waters. This study addresses the removal of Fe, P, and As from streams in lowland catchments fed by reduced, Ferich groundwater (average: 20 mg Fe L−1). The concentrations of dissolved Fe ({\textless}0.45 μm) in streams gradually decrease with increasing hydraulic residence time (travel time) of the water in the catchment. The removal of Fe from streamwater is governed by chemical reactions and hydrological processes: the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and the subsequent formation of particulate Fe oxyhydroxides proceeds as the water ﬂows through the catchment into increasingly larger streams. The Fe removal exhibits ﬁrst-order kinetics with a mean half-life of 12 h, a value in line with predictions by a kinetic model for Fe(II) oxidation. The Fe concentrations in streams vary seasonally: they are higher in winter than in summer, due to shorter hydraulic residence time and lower temperature in winter. The removal of P and As is much faster than that of Fe. The average concentrations of P and As in streams (42 μg P L−1 and 1.4 μg As L−1) are 1 order of magnitude below those in groundwater (393 μg P L−1 and 17 μg As L−1). This removal is attributed to fast sequestration by oxidizing Fe when the water enters oxic environments, possibly by adsorption on Fe oxyhydroxides or by formation of ferric phosphates. The average P and As concentrations in groundwater largely exceed local environmental limits for freshwater (140 μg P L−1 and 3 μg As L−1), but in streams, they are below these limits. Naturally occurring Fe in groundwater may alleviate the environmental risk associated with P and As in the receiving streams.},

	abstract = {The promulgation of numeric nutrient criteria for evaluating impairment of waterbodies in Florida is underway. Adherence to the water quality standards needed to meet these criteria will potentially require substantial allocations of public and private resources in order to better control nutrient (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) releases from contributing sources. Major sources of nutrients include atmospheric deposition (195e380 mg-N/m2/yr, 6 to 16 mg-P/m2/yr), reclaimed water irrigation (0.13e29 mg-N/L, 0.02 to 6 mg-P/L), septic systems (3.3 Â 103e6.68 Â 103 g-N/person/yr, 0.49 Â 103e0.85 Â 103 g-P/person/yr) and fertilizer applications (8 Â 106e24 Â 106 mg-N/m2/yr). Estimated nitrogen loadings to the Florida environment, as calculated from the above rates are as follows: 5.9 Â 109e9.4 Â 109 g-N/yr from atmospheric deposition, 1.2 Â 108e2.6 Â 1010 g-N/yr from reclaimed water, 2.4 Â 1010e4.9 Â 1010 g-N/year from septic systems, and 1.4 Â 1011 g-N/yr from fertilizer application. Similarly, source speciﬁc phosphorus loading calculations are also presented in this paper. A fraction of those nutrient inputs may reach receiving waterbodies depending upon site speciﬁc regulation on nutrient control, nutrient management practices, and environmental attenuation. In Florida, the interconnectivity of hydrologic pathways due to the karst landscape and high volumes of rainfall add to the complexity of tracking nutrient loads back to their sources. In addition to source speciﬁc nutrient loadings, this review discusses the merits of source speciﬁc markers such as elemental isotopes (boron, nitrogen, oxygen, strontium, uranium and carbon) and trace organic compounds (sucralose, gadolinium anomaly, carbamazepine, and galaxolide) in relating nutrient loads back to sources of origin. Although this review is focused in Florida, the development of source speciﬁc markers as a tool for tracing nutrient loadings back to sources of origin is applicable and of value to all other geographical locations.},

The proposed method provides a linear response over the concentration range 2.5–20000 ng/kg with correlation coefﬁcients higher than 0.994 in all cases. Also, it features low limits of detection (0.8–5.1 ng/kg), good precision (within- and between-day relative standard deviation less than 7\%) and recoveries ranging from 91 to 101\%.

	abstract = {A dynamic model for eutrophication incorporating phytoplankton and nutrients in the overlying water, submerged macrophytes Potamogeton pectinatus L., and nutrient dynamics in sediments was developed as a functional tool to understand the effects of macrophytes on algal blooming in shallow lakes. The submodule for the overlying water treats three types of phytoplankton (diatoms, green and blue green algae), the macro-nutrients, as well as dissolved oxygen in the water, while the macrophyte submodule consists of equations for the time-dependence of the macrophyte components: shoots, secondary shoots, roots, tubers, and new tubers. The sediment submodule describes the concentrations of detritus, nitrates, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, and phosphates. These modules are processed simultaneously. The model was applied to the Lake Veluwe (Netherlands) experiment, successfully reproducing the seasonal changes in the lake, such as the transition of the dominant species of phytoplankton from diatoms during spring, green algae in summer, to blue green algae in late autumn depending on the nutrient and light condition, nutrient concentration in the water, and the yearly life-cycle of macrophytes. The model also describes the long term transition in the lake: after artiﬁcial ﬂushing with water rich in nitrates and calcium, the return ﬂux from the sediment decreased, and together with the reduction in the external load, the phosphate concentration in the overlying water decreased. This lessened the phytoplankton biomass in the water, which resulted in the remarkable development of macrophytes under the improved light condition. Sensitivity analyses of important coefﬁcients indicated that the maximum photosynthesis and respiration rate are the most sensitive parameters for macrophyte and algal development. The parameters have sufﬁcient accuracy to be successfully applied to other experiments. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The predictions of the model for biomass of each fraction, standing stock of phosphorus and phosphorus content in shoots, secondary shoots and roots well agree with the observed values.

A series of numerical experiments were subsequently carried out to investigate the long-term effects of macrophyte decomposition on the nutrient budget of a hypothetical lake. Results show that phosphorus released in the decomposition process of macrophytes in the lake can be reduced signiﬁcantly, at least by 75\%, if the above-ground macrophyte biomass is harvested at the end of the growing season.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivativefree optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to ﬁnd near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and reﬁne a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We ﬁnd that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of reﬁning a nearoptimal solution.},

	abstract = {The need for predictive process-oriented planktonic ecosystem models is widely recognized by the aquatic science community. We conducted a meta-analysis of recent mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical models (153 studies published from 1990 to 2002), to assess their ability to predict spatial and temporal patterns in the physical, chemical and biological dynamics of planktonic systems. The selected modeling studies covered a wide range of model complexity, ecosystem-types, spatio-temporal scales and purposes for model development. Despite the heterogeneous nature of this data set, we were able to identify model behavior trends and illuminate aspects of current modeling practice that need to be reevaluated. Temperature and dissolved oxygen had the highest coefficients of determination (respective median r2 values were 0.93 and 0.70) and the lowest relative error (median RE {\textless} 10\%), nutrients and phytoplankton had intermediate predictability (median r2 values ranging from 0.40 to 0.60 and median RE {\textasciitilde} 40\%), whereas bacteria (median r2 = 0.06) and zooplankton (median RE = 70\%) dynamics were poorly predicted. Longer simulation periods (i.e. months to decades) reduced model predictability, and increased model complexity did not improve fit. Aquatic biogeochemical modelers need to be more consistent in how they apply conventional methodological steps during model development (i.e. sensitivity analysis, validation), and the aquatic modeling community should adopt generally accepted standards of model performance. Recent advancements in data assimilation techniques, the combination of the present family of models with goal functions (derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the development of models with a stronger physiological basis are promising frameworks for obtaining more accurate simulations of planktonic processes.},

	abstract = {Complex environmental models are often criticized as being difﬁcult to analyze and poorly identiﬁable due to their nonlinearities and/or their large number of parameters relative to data availability. Others consider overparameterized models to be useful, especially for predicting system dynamics beyond the conditions for which the model was calibrated. In this paper, we present a complex eutrophication model that has been developed to simulate plankton dynamics in Lake Washington, USA. Because this model is to be used for testing alternative managerial schemes, the inclusion of multiple elemental cycles (org. C, N, P, Si, O) and multiple functional phytoplankton (diatoms, green algae and cyanobacteria) and zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) groups was deemed necessary. The model also takes into account recent advances in stoichiometric nutrient recycling theory, and the zooplankton grazing term was reformulated to include algal food quality effects on zooplankton assimilation efﬁciency. The physical structure of the model is simple and consists of two spatial compartments representing the lake epilimnion and hypolimnion. Global sensitivity analysis showed background light attenuation, the maximum phytoplankton growth rate, the phytoplankton basal metabolic rate, the zooplankton maximum grazing rate and the grazing half saturation constant have the greatest impact on model behavior. Phytoplankton phosphorus stoichiometry (maximum and minimum internal concentrations, maximum uptake rate) interacts with these parameters and determines the plankton dynamics (epilimnetic and hypolimnetic phytoplankton biomass, proportion of cyanobacteria and total zooplankton biomass). Sensitivity analysis of the model forcing functions indicated the importance of both external and internal loading for simulating epilimnetic and hypolimnetic plankton dynamics. These results will be used to calibrate the model, to reproduce present chemical and biological properties of Lake Washington and to test this lake’s potential response to different external nutrient loading scenarios.},

For the Sacramento River, we review existing climate data and research on impacts and describe the progress in implementing various adaptation strategies. We ﬁnd that the Durance and Sacramento—while certainly at different scales—nonetheless share many characteristics, such as a highly variable climate and hydrology, and extensive hydromodiﬁcation and intense water competition, which will be affected by climate change. Although some issues and approaches to adaptation are unique to each region, at the same time, these two river basins are utilizing some similar strategies to cope with a changing climate, such as regional planning and management and water conservation.},

All biomass types were affected by PAR and DOX, with anammox being the most sensitive bacteria. DOX inhibited more the biomass treating high strength nitrogenous efﬂuents (HSNE) than low strength nitrogenous efﬂuents (LSNE). The phosphorus uptake inhibition under anoxic conditions was lower than 25\% in the presence of PAR up to 400 mg LÀ1. The same DOX concentration inhibited anoxic phosphorus uptake more than 65\% for biomass treating LSNE and HSNE. Heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria seem to be more robust at high DOX and PAR concentrations than anammox.

Sediment samples from 40 sites of 3 estuaries of Cantabria (Spain) were classified with respect to 13 physical, chemical and toxicological variables using the SOM. Results obtained with the SOM, when compared to those of traditional multivariate statistical techniques commonly used in the field of sediment quality (principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)), provided a more useful classification for further assessment steps. Especially, the powerful visualization tools of the SOM, which offer more information and in an easier way than HCA and PCA, facilitate the task of establishing an order of priority between the distinguished groups of sites depending on their need for further investigations or remediation actions in subsequent management steps.},

	abstract = {Background: During the last decades the frequency and global distribution of toxic cyanobacteria blooms has increased globally, which has been attributed to the eutrophication and climate change. In Chile there have been reports on blooms in aquatic ecosystem in localities with high density population and on the presence of five congeners of microcystins but only two documented toxics blooms with hundreds fish kills. We investigated the presence of toxic cyanobacteria blooms in the Lo Galindo urban lake, Concepción city, and the environmental factors that influence the abundance of cyanobacteria and microcystins concentration. Lo Galindo Lake, is used for various recreational and eventually as a drinking water source.
Results: Toxic blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa are developed in Lo Galindo lake, those that occur throughout the year in a wide range of environmental conditions, forming scums blooms during summer and dispersive blooms in all seasons. There are different microcystin congeners, the most frequent congener was MC-RR (21 \%) and the highest concentration corresponded to 115.4 µg L-1 MC-LR.
Conclusions: The dominance and development of the M. aeruginosa blooms in the lake is determined by various environmental factors such as temperature, nutrients, diversity of taxa and wind speed that affect the formation of disperse-type blooms and/or scums; the latter are developed only in summer, coinciding with the highest temperature and concentrations of total microcystins. In the lake the microcystin and different types of congener is highly variable, so special care is recommended to use lake water for consumption and for recreational activities. The emergence and persistence of Microcystis blooms in this body of water are considered a potential health risk for the inhabitants of the area, considering the proximity and the system use by the inhabitants.},

We identified the key response variables within a lake that act as indicators of the effects of climate change on both the lake and the catchment. These variables reflect a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological responses to climate. However, the efficacy of the different indicators is affected by regional response to climate change, characteristics of the catchment, and lake mixing regimes. Thus, particular indicators or combinations of indicators are more effective for different lake types and geographic regions. The extraction of climate signals can be further complicated by the influence of other environmental changes, such as eutrophication or acidification, and the equivalent reverse phenomena, in addition to other land-use influences. In many cases, however, confounding factors can be addressed through analytical tools such as detrending or filtering. Lakes are effective sentinels for climate change because they are sensitive to climate, respond rapidly to change, and integrate information about changes in the catchment.},

In both approaches, single and multi-response, efﬁciency criteria are commonly used by hydrologists to provide an objective assessment of the “closeness” of the simulated behaviour to the observed measurements. While there are a few efﬁciency criteria such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency, coefﬁcient of determination, and index of agreement that are frequently used in hydrologic modeling studies and reported in the literature, there are a large number of other efﬁciency criteria to choose from. The selection and use of speciﬁc efﬁciency criteria and the interpretation of the results can be a challenge for even the most experienced hydrologist since each criterion may place different emphasis on different types of simulated and observed behaviours.

	title = {Estimation of the photosynthesis/irradiance \{\vphantom{\}}{PII}) curve parameters from light and dark bottle experiments},
	abstract = {Light and dark bottle experiments, carried out in three systems in the Netherlands, were used to estimate the parameters of models relating the oxygen production rate to incident light intensity. The maximum production rate (PM) and the light saturation constant (/s) were estimated using both gross and nett oxygen production data. In the latter case, the community oxygen consumption rate (Rox) was also estimated. Eight models were compared with respect to goodness of fit, as has been accomplished previously by Jassby and Platt (Limnol. Oceanogr, 21, 540-547, 1976) and many others. This study, however, emphasizes the problem of parameter correlation and the consequential usefulness of these type of experiments to identify the PII curve parameters. The results show that at a 90\% level of confidence, the models cannot be distinguished with respect to goodness of fit. However, the models do show distinct differences in parameter correlation. Parameter correlation was shown to be related to the shape of the curve. P/I curves with high convexity were shown to be less sensitive for parameter correlation. In particular, models showing low convexity suffer from overparameterization, which means that on the basis of the observed production rates it is difficult to discriminate between the parameters. Also, alternative model formulations, using PM and the initial slope (a), were investigated. These formulations produced less parameter correlation. However, for models with low convexity, showing high parameter correlation anyway, the reduction is limited. The use of nett oxygen production data does not show a significant difference in fit at a 90\% confidence level. However, measured Ro\% from dark bottle experiments tends to be higher than the values found by estimating Rox from nett oxygen production.},

Four traps were set, at 50, 100, 300, 600 m depths on the mooring in 645 m deep water in the Lacaze-Duthier canyon. The total metal concentrations were determined by ICP-MS. Results show that Rb and SC contents display typical shale values. As, Cd, Pb, Sb, Zn, (normalized to SC) display high enrichment factors (up to 50) over shale compositions. Distinctive temporal variability as well as the respective contributions of local (Tct, Aude) and remote (RhBne) rivers and Sahara-derived aerosols have been identified. Fluxes of most elements observed in the upper 100 m can be attributed to atmospheric fluxes. In the deepest traps (300 and 600 m) these fluxes are, however, mostly dominated by riverine particles advected from the continental shelf. Most of the trace-element enrichments are more likely to be related to the anthropogenic input, rather than to biological cycling. Isotopic composition of lead determined by ICPMS enabled to evaluate that the proportion of anthropogenic lead derived from European gasoline consumption ranged between 50 and 100\%.},

We paired a 20 y freshwater microbial community time series with zooplankton and phytoplankton counts, rich environmental data, and a 6 y cyanotoxin time series. We observed strong microbial phenological patterns that were disrupted by the invasions of spiny water flea (
              Bythotrephes cederströmii
              ) and zebra mussels (
              Dreissena polymorpha
              ). First, we detected shifts in
              Cyanobacteria
              phenology. After the spiny water flea invasion,
              Cyanobacteria
              dominance crept earlier into clearwater; and after the zebra mussel invasion,
              Cyanobacteria
              abundance crept even earlier into the diatom-dominated spring. During summer, the spiny water flea invasion sparked a cascade of shifting diversity where zooplankton diversity decreased and
              Cyanobacteria
              diversity increased. Second, we detected shifts in cyanotoxin phenology. After the zebra mussel invasion, microcystin increased in early summer and the duration of toxin production increased by over a month. Third, we observed shifts in heterotrophic bacteria phenology. The
              Bacteroidota
              phylum and members of the acI
              Nanopelagicales

The proportion of the bacterial community that changed differed by season; spring and clearwater communities changed most following the spiny water flea invasion that lessened clearwater intensity, while summer communities changed least following the zebra mussel invasion despite the shifts in
              Cyanobacteria
              diversity and toxicity. A modeling framework identified the invasions as primary drivers of the observed phenological changes.

	abstract = {Lakes might be sentinels of climate change, but the uncertainty in their main feedback to the atmosphere – heat-exchange fluxes – is often not considered within climate models. Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (Kd). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue – different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results – the answer to the question was unequivocal: Kd, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which Kd is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of Kd could reduce modeling uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Four limnocorrals (8 m dia. by 15 m deep) located at Lake St. George, Ontario, Canada; were used to examine the interactions between planktivorous fish, crustacean zooplankton (notably Daphnia galeata mendotae), and phytoplankton. During the spring, in all of the limnocorrals, high Daphnia biomasses were correlated with increased water transparency and a spring ‘clear-water’ phase. However, as the summer progressed, the relationship between Daphnia biomass and phytoplankton abundance became more complex and less predictable. Investigation of these interactions suggested four conclusions. (1) During late July and throughout August and September, water transparency decreased and algal cell counts increased. In 3 of 4 limnocorrals, deterioration in water quality occurred 3–5 weeks before zooplankton (and Daphnia populations) declined. In all cases decreased transparency was associated with increased concentrations of algal cells (Gloeococcus) that were poor food sources for Daphnia. These results suggested that decreased water transparency was not ‘caused by’ decreases in Daphnia biomass. (2) Taken together, data from all of the limnocorrals showed no correlation between the magnitude of July Daphnia biomasses and the percentage of ‘poor food source’ algae that were observed in August. This suggested that grazer effects were not necessary for the onset of summer ‘poor food source’ algal blooms. (3) In two limnocorrals, there was a positive correlation between increased Daphnia mortality and the onset of ‘poor food source’ blooms. In the other two limnocorrals there was no correlation. In all limnocorrals there was no correlation between decreased Daphnia reproductive capacity and ‘poor food source’ blooms. These data suggested that blooms of ‘poor food source’ algae were not necessary for the collapse of Daphnia populations. (4) In all 4 limnocorrals there was a strong correlation between the time that 0+ yellow perch planktivores reached biomasses of 30–50 kg ha−1 and the collapse of Daphnia populations Species and size selection was also observed. These results suggested that for this set of limnocorral experiments, fish biomasses in the 30–50 kg ha−1 were responsible for the collapse of Daphnia populations in the summer.},

	abstract = {The freshwater–marine transition that characterizes an estuarine system can provide multiple entry options for invading species, yet the relative importance of this gradient in determining the functional contribution of invading species has received little attention. The ecological consequences of species invasion are routinely evaluated within a freshwater versus marine context, even though many invasive species can inhabit a wide range of salinities. We investigate the functional consequences of different sizes of Corbicula fluminea—an invasive species able to adapt to a wide range of temperatures and salinity—across the freshwater–marine transition in the presence versus absence of warming. Specifically, we characterize how C. fluminea affect fluid and particle transport, important processes in mediating nutrient cycling (NH
4‐N, NO
3‐N, PO
4‐P). Results showed that sediment particle reworking (bioturbation) tends to be influenced by size and to a lesser extent, temperature and salinity; nutrient concentrations are influenced by different interactions between all variables (salinity, temperature, and size class). Our findings demonstrate the highly context‐dependent nature of the ecosystem consequences of invasion and highlight the potential for species to simultaneously occupy multiple components of an ecosystem. Recognizing of this aspect of invasibility is fundamental to management and conservation efforts, particularly as freshwater and marine systems tend to be compartmentalized rather than be treated as a contiguous unit. We conclude that more comprehensive appreciation of the distribution of invasive species across adjacent habitats and different seasons is urgently needed to allow the true extent of biological introductions, and their ecological consequences, to be fully realized.},

              Homo sapiens
              . A crucial outcome of such behaviors has been the dramatic reshaping of the global biosphere, a transformation whose early origins are increasingly apparent from cumulative archaeological and paleoecological datasets. Such data suggest that, by the Late Pleistocene, humans had begun to engage in activities that have led to alterations in the distributions of a vast array of species across most, if not all, taxonomic groups. Changes to biodiversity have included extinctions, extirpations, and shifts in species composition, diversity, and community structure. We outline key examples of these changes, highlighting findings from the study of new datasets, like ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotopes, and microfossils, as well as the application of new statistical and computational methods to datasets that have accumulated significantly in recent decades. We focus on four major phases that witnessed broad anthropogenic alterations to biodiversity—the Late Pleistocene global human expansion, the Neolithic spread of agriculture, the era of island colonization, and the emergence of early urbanized societies and commercial networks. Archaeological evidence documents millennia of anthropogenic transformations that have created novel ecosystems around the world. This record has implications for ecological and evolutionary research, conservation strategies, and the maintenance of ecosystem services, pointing to a significant need for broader cross-disciplinary engagement between archaeology and the biological and environmental sciences.},

	abstract = {Climate change is asymmetrically altering environmental conditions in space, from local to global scales, creating novel heterogeneity. Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize — or rewire — food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring — a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring — changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web’s interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists’ responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional (1-D) physically based lake model was coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.2 developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research to dynamically simulate physical processes of lakes and their effects on weather and climate at local and regional scales. Our study area is focused on the Great Lakes. This coupled model realistically reproduces the lake surface temperature (LST) at a buoy station in a shallow lake (Lake Erie) while generating strong LST biases ranging from −20 to 20 °C at a buoy station in a deep lake (Lake Superior). Through many sensitivity tests, we find that the biases in the deep lake LST simulations result from the drastic underestimation of heat transfer between the lower and upper parts of the lake through unrealistic eddy diffusion. Additional tests were made to calibrate the eddy diffusivity in WRF-Lake. It is found that when this parameter is multiplied by a factor ranging from 102 to 105 for various lake depths deeper than 15 m, the LST simulations for the deep lake buoy station show good agreement with observations, and the bias range reduces to ±4 °C. Essentially, the enlarged eddy diffusivity strengthens heat transfer within the lake columns in the deep lake, which is significantly underestimated in the lake model without calibration. Validation simulations with the calibrated eddy diffusivity were carried out for the whole of Lake Superior and Lake Erie. The LST simulations still have a substantial bias reduction when compared with those produced with the original eddy diffusivity, indicating that the calibrated parameter is representative. In addition, the improved 1-D lake model with WRF reasonably reproduces the remotely sensed LST geographic distribution.},

The annual variation in the net heat flux can be adequately described using a six-term heat balance equation based on 12 years of monthly mean meteorological and surface temperature data. Although the magnitude of the net heat flux is dominated by the radiative terms of the equation, the one-month backward shift of the net flux and total heat content extrema from the solstices and equinoxes respectively is due to the phase shift of the non-radiative with respect to the radiative terms. A linear approximation was used to express the net heat flux in terms of a heat exchange coefficient and an equilibrium temperature. The former varies from 17 to 28 W·m−2·K−1 in the course of a year; fluctuations in the latter are found to depend mainly on fluctuations in cloud cover and relative humidity, whilst the effect of fluctuations in air temperature and wind speed is slight.},

The open source, Fortran-based Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models addresses these problems by providing a consistent set of programming interfaces through which hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models communicate. Models are coded once to connect to FABM, after which arbitrary combinations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models can be made. Thus, a biogeochemical model code works unmodified within models of a chemostat, a vertically structured water column, and a three-dimensional basin. Moreover, complex biogeochemistry can be distributed over many compact, self-contained modules, coupled at run-time. By enabling distributed development and user-controlled coupling of biogeochemical models, FABM enables optimal use of the expertise of scientists, programmers and end-users.},

	abstract = {Physics-based models are often used to study engineering and environmental systems. The ability to model these systems is the key to achieving our future environmental sustainability and improving the quality of human life. This article focuses on simulating lake water temperature, which is critical for understanding the impact of changing climate on aquatic ecosystems and assisting in aquatic resource management decisions. General Lake Model (GLM) is a state-of-the-art physics-based model used for addressing such problems. However, like other physics-based models used for studying scientific and engineering systems, it has several well-known limitations due to simplified representations of the physical processes being modeled or challenges in selecting appropriate parameters. While state-of-the-art machine learning models can sometimes outperform physics-based models given ample amount of training data, they can produce results that are physically inconsistent. This article proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN) that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and improves the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physics-based models (by over 20\% even with very little training data), while generating outputs consistent with physical laws. An important aspect of our PGRNN approach lies in its ability to incorporate the knowledge encoded in physics-based models. This allows training the PGRNN model using very few true observed data while also ensuring high prediction accuracy. Although we present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines where physics-based (also known as mechanistic) models are used.},

	abstract = {Lake ecosystems, and the organisms that live within them, are vulnerable to temperature change1–5, including the increased occurrence of thermal extremes6. However, very little is known about lake heatwaves—periods of extreme warm lake surface water temperature—and how they may change under global warming. Here we use satellite observations and a numerical model to investigate changes in lake heatwaves for hundreds of lakes worldwide from 1901 to 2099. We show that lake heatwaves will become hotter and longer by the end of the twenty-first century. For the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), the average intensity of lake heatwaves, defined relative to the historical period (1970 to 1999), will increase from 3.7 ± 0.1 to 5.4 ± 0.8 degrees Celsius and their average duration will increase dramatically from 7.7 ± 0.4 to 95.5 ± 35.3 days. In the low-greenhouse-gas-emission RCP 2.6 scenario, heatwave intensity and duration will increase to 4.0 ± 0.2 degrees Celsius and 27.0 ± 7.6 days, respectively. Surface heatwaves are longer-lasting but less intense in deeper lakes (up to 60 metres deep) than in shallower lakes during both historic and future periods. As lakes warm during the twenty-first century7,8, their heatwaves will begin to extend across multiple seasons, with some lakes reaching a permanent heatwave state. Lake heatwaves are likely to exacerbate the adverse effects of long-term warming in lakes and exert widespread influence on their physical structure and chemical properties. Lake heatwaves could alter species composition by pushing aquatic species and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience. This in turn could threaten lake biodiversity9 and the key ecological and economic benefits that lakes provide to society.},

In addition, future projections of these properties are limited to individual lakes or global simulations from single lake models. Here we uncover the human imprint on lakes worldwide using hindcasts and projections from five lake models. Reanalysed trends in lake temperature and ice cover in recent decades are extremely unlikely to be explained by pre-industrial climate variability alone. Ice-cover trends in reanalysis are consistent with lake model simulations under historical conditions, providing attribution of lake changes to anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, lake temperature, ice thickness and duration scale robustly with global mean air temperature across future climate scenarios (+0.9 °C °Cair–1, –0.033 m °Cair–1 and –9.7 d °Cair–1, respectively).

	abstract = {Abstract. Empirical evidence demonstrates that lakes and reservoirs are warming across
the globe. Consequently, there is an increased need to project future
changes in lake thermal structure and resulting changes in lake
biogeochemistry in order to plan for the likely impacts. Previous studies of
the impacts of climate change on lakes have often relied on a single model
forced with limited scenario-driven projections of future climate for a
relatively small number of lakes. As a result, our understanding of the
effects of climate change on lakes is fragmentary, based on scattered
studies using different data sources and modelling protocols, and mainly
focused on individual lakes or lake regions. This has precluded
identification of the main impacts of climate change on lakes at global and
regional scales and has likely contributed to the lack of lake water quality
considerations in policy-relevant documents, such as the Assessment Reports
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Here, we describe a
simulation protocol developed by the Lake Sector of the Inter-Sectoral
Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) for simulating climate change
impacts on lakes using an ensemble of lake models and climate change
scenarios for ISIMIP phases 2 and 3. The protocol prescribes lake
simulations driven by climate forcing from gridded observations and
different Earth system models under various representative greenhouse gas
concentration pathways (RCPs), all consistently bias-corrected on a
0.5∘ × 0.5∘ global grid. In ISIMIP phase 2, 11 lake
models were forced with these data to project the thermal structure of 62
well-studied lakes where data were available for calibration under
historical conditions, and using uncalibrated models for 17 500 lakes
defined for all global grid cells containing lakes. In ISIMIP phase 3, this
approach was expanded to consider more lakes, more models, and more
processes. The ISIMIP Lake Sector is the largest international effort to
project future water temperature, thermal structure, and ice phenology of
lakes at local and global scales and paves the way for future simulations of
the impacts of climate change on water quality and biogeochemistry in lakes.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..1812356G},
	abstract = {Coastal aquifer systems are used intensively to meet the growing demands for water in those regions. They are especially at risk for the intrusion of seawater due to aquifer overpumping, limited groundwater replenishment and unsustainable groundwater management which in turn also impacts the social and economical development of coastal regions. One example is the Al-Batinah coastal plain in northern Oman where irrigated agriculture is practiced by lots of small scaled farms in different distances from the sea, each of them pumping their water from coastal aquifer. Due to continuous overpumping and progressing saltwater intrusion farms near the coast had to close since water for irrigation got too saline. For investigating appropriate management options numerical density dependent groundwater modelling is required which should also portray the adaption of groundwater abstraction schemes on the water quality. For addressing this challenge a moving inner boundary condition is implemented in the numerical density dependent groundwater model which adjusts the locations for groundwater abstraction according to the position of the seawater intrusion front controlled by thresholds of relative chloride concentration. The adaption process is repeated for each management cycle within transient model simulations and allows for considering feedbacks with the consumers e.g. the agriculture by moving agricultural farms more inland or towards the sea if more fertile soils at the coast could be recovered. For finding optimal water management strategies efficiently, the behaviour of the numerical groundwater model for different extraction and replenishment scenarios is approximated by an artificial neural network using a novel approach for state space surrogate model development. Afterwards the derived surrogate is coupled with an agriculture module within a simulation based water management optimisation framework to achieve optimal cropping pattern and water abstraction schemes regarding multiple objectives like aquifer sustainability and profitable agriculture. Results obtained for the above mentioned region show that the surrogate model has a very good interpolation capability i.e. it is able to reproduce unknown states obtained by numerical model simulations within the range of its training data. Furthermore, the importance of portraying the adaptive behaviour of farmers on water quality is underlined to develop management scenarios more realistically. However, results of a stop pumping scenario show that it is not possible to push back an advanced seawater intrusion in a time period of 200 years. Therefore, combinations of technical and adaptive measures are required.},

              Microcystis
              growth and microcystin production. Simulations for Lake Erie suggest that the observed toxigenic-to-nontoxigenic strain succession during the 2014 Toledo drinking water crisis was controlled by different cellular oxidative stress mitigation strategies (protection by microcystin versus degradation by enzymes) and the different susceptibility of those mechanisms to nitrogen limitation. This model, as well as a simpler empirical one, predicts that the planned phosphorus load reduction will lower biomass but make nitrogen and light more available, which will increase toxin production, favor toxigenic cells, and increase toxin concentrations.

          ,
            Nutrient control must include nitrogen

              Lake Erie receives water from important agricultural areas of Canada and the United States and is subject to high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff. These nutrients can lead to rapid growth of photosynthetic organisms, some of which produce toxins that harm aquatic animals and compromise drinking water. Recent efforts have focused on reducing phosphorus loading. With support from a large literature meta-analysis, Hellweger
              et al
              . developed an agent-based model of cyanobacterial metabolism to determine how toxin production changed under a range of nutrient and environmental conditions and defined the associated molecular mechanisms (see the Perspective by Ofiţeru and Picioreanu). They found that phosphorus reduction alone was potentially harmful, lowering total biomass but increasing toxin production. The proposed mechanism involves response to hydrogen peroxide stress and increased light transmission. —MAF

          ,

              Cyanobacterial algal blooms, particularly the ones that produce powerful toxins, are a grave threat to lake ecosystems around the world. One such toxin is microcystin, which was the cause of a drinking water crisis in 2014 in Toledo, Ohio. In an effort to curb algal blooms in Lake Erie, American and Canadian government agencies agreed on a plan to control excessive algal growth in the lake (

	abstract = {Abstract. Numerical models are an important tool for simulating
temperature, hydrodynamics, and water quality in lakes and reservoirs.
Existing models differ in dimensionality by considering spatial variations
of simulated parameters (e.g., flow velocity and water temperature) in one
(1D), two (2D) or three (3D) spatial dimensions. The different approaches
are based on different levels of simplification in the description of
hydrodynamic processes and result in different demands on computational
power. The aim of this study is to compare three models with different
dimensionalities and to analyze differences between model results in relation
to model simplifications. We analyze simulations of thermal stratification,
flow velocity and substance transport by density currents in a medium-sized
drinking-water reservoir in the subtropical zone, using three widely used
open-source models: GLM (1D), CE-QUAL-W2 (2D) and Delft3D (3D). The models
were operated with identical initial and boundary conditions over a 1-year
period. Their performance was assessed by comparing model results with
measurements of temperature, flow velocity and turbulence. Our results show
that all models were capable of simulating the seasonal changes in water
temperature and stratification. Flow velocities, only available for the 2D
and 3D approaches, were more challenging to reproduce, but 3D simulations
showed closer agreement with observations. With increasing dimensionality,
the quality of the simulations also increased in terms of error, correlation
and variance. None of the models provided good agreement with observations
in terms of mixed layer depth, which also affects the spreading of inflowing
water as density currents and the results of water quality models that
build on outputs of the hydrodynamic models.},

            Species invasions are a leading threat to ecosystems globally, but our understanding of interactions among multiple invasive species and their outcomes on ecosystem properties is undeveloped despite their significance to conservation and management. Here we studied a large lake in Minnesota, USA, that experienced a simultaneous surge in invasive zebra mussel and spiny water flea populations. A long-term (2000–2018) dataset offered a rare opportunity to assess whole-ecosystem shifts following the co-invasion. Within two years, the native crustacean zooplankton community declined abruptly in density and productivity (−93\% and −91\%, respectively). Summer phytoplankton abundance and water clarity remained stable across the time series, an unexpected outcome given the high density of zebra mussels in the lake. Observational data and modeling indicate that removal of native herbivorous zooplankton by the predatory spiny water flea reduced zooplankton grazing pressure enough to compensate new grazing losses due to zebra mussels, resulting in a zero net effect on phytoplankton abundance and water clarity despite a wholesale shift in secondary production from the pelagic to the benthic food web. This study reveals the extent of direct and indirect effects of two aquatic invaders on food-web processes that cancel shifts in water clarity, a highly valued ecosystem service.},

            The ecosystems of the Laurentian Great Lakes have been dramatically reengineered by invasive bottom-dwelling dreissenid mussels. A key question is whether this biological change has altered whole-ecosystem biogeochemistry, in particular the cycling of phosphorus, a key nutrient that limits biological productivity in freshwater ecosystems. We show that phosphorus cycling in the invaded Great Lakes is now regulated by the population dynamics of a single benthic species, the quagga mussel. This qualitatively changes the responses of the affected lakes to phosphorus inputs from watersheds, complicates predictions, and necessitates a new paradigm for managing these large aquatic ecosystems. Similar changes likely play out in many other dreissenid-invaded lakes across Europe and North America.
          ,
            The productivity of aquatic ecosystems depends on the supply of limiting nutrients. The invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes, the world’s largest freshwater ecosystem, by dreissenid (zebra and quagga) mussels has dramatically altered the ecology of these lakes. A key open question is how dreissenids affect the cycling of phosphorus (P), the nutrient that limits productivity in the Great Lakes. We show that a single species, the quagga mussel, is now the primary regulator of P cycling in the lower four Great Lakes. By virtue of their enormous biomass, quagga mussels sequester large quantities of P in their tissues and dramatically intensify benthic P exchanges. Mass balance analysis reveals a previously unrecognized sensitivity of the Great Lakes ecosystem, where P availability is now regulated by the dynamics of mussel populations while the role of the external inputs of phosphorus is suppressed. Our results show that a single invasive species can have dramatic consequences for geochemical cycles even in the world’s largest aquatic ecosystems. The ongoing spread of dreissenids across a multitude of lakes in North America and Europe is likely to affect carbon and nutrient cycling in these systems for many decades, with important implications for water quality management.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have long studied patterns, directions and tempos of change, but there is a pressing need to extend current understanding to empirical observations of abrupt changes as climate warming accelerates. Abrupt changes in ecological systems (ACES)—changes that are fast in time or fast relative to their drivers—are ubiquitous and increasing in frequency. Powerful theoretical frameworks exist, yet applications in real-world landscapes to detect, explain and anticipate ACES have lagged. We highlight five insights emerging from empirical studies of ACES across diverse ecosystems: (i) ecological systems show ACES in some dimensions but not others; (ii) climate extremes may be more important than mean climate in generating ACES; (iii) interactions among multiple drivers often produce ACES; (iv) contingencies, such as ecological memory, frequency and sequence of disturbances, and spatial context are important; and (v) tipping points are often (but not always) associated with ACES. We suggest research priorities to advance understanding of ACES in the face of climate change. Progress in understanding ACES requires strong integration of scientific approaches (theory, observations, experiments and process-based models) and high-quality empirical data drawn from a diverse array of ecosystems.

	abstract = {Introductions or invasions of nonnative organisms can mediate major changes in the trophic structure of aquatic ecosystems. Here we document multitrophic level impacts in a spatially extensive system that played out over more than a century. Positive interactions among exotic vertebrate and invertebrate predators caused a substantial and abrupt shift in community composition resulting in a trophic cascade that extended to primary producers and to a nonaquatic species, the bald eagle. The opossum shrimp,
              Mysis diluviana
              , invaded Flathead Lake, Montana, the largest freshwater lake in the western United States. Lake trout had been introduced 80 y prior but remained at low densities until nonnative
              Mysis
              became established. The bottom-dwelling mysids eliminated a recruitment bottleneck for lake trout by providing a deep water source of food where little was available previously. Lake trout subsequently flourished on mysids and this voracious piscivore now dominates the lake fishery; formerly abundant kokanee were extirpated, and native bull and westslope cutthroat trout are imperiled. Predation by
              Mysis
              shifted zooplankton and phytoplankton community size structure. Bayesian change point analysis of primary productivity (27-y time series) showed a significant step increase of 55 mg C m
              −2
              d
              −1
              (i.e., 21\% rise) concurrent with the mysid invasion, but little trend before or after despite increasing nutrient loading.
              Mysis
              facilitated predation by lake trout and indirectly caused the collapse of kokanee, redirecting energy flow through the ecosystem that would otherwise have been available to other top predators (bald eagles).},

	abstract = {Zooplankton samples for the 4 southern Wisconsin LTER lakes (Mendota, Monona, Wingra, Fish) have been collected for analysis by LTER since 1995 (1996 Wingra, Fish) when the southern Wisconsin lakes were added to the North Temperate Lakes LTER project. Samples are collected as a vertical tow using an 80-micron mesh conical net with a 30-cm diameter opening (net mouth: net length ratio = 1:3) consistent with sampling conducted by the Wisconsin Dept. Natural Resources in prior years. Zooplankton tows are taken in the deep hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling; zooplankton samples are preserved in 70\% ethanol for later processing. Samples are usually collected with standard tow depths on most dates (e.g., 20 meters for Lake Mendota) but not always, so tow depth is recorded as a variate in the database. Crustacean species are identified and counted for Mendota and Monona and body lengths are recorded for a portion of each species identified (see data protocol for counting procedure); samples for Wingra and Fish lakes are archived but not routinely counted. Numerical densities for Mendota and Monona zooplankton samples are reported in the database as number or organisms per square meter without correcting for net efficiency. [Net efficiency varies from a maximum of about 70\% under clear water conditions; net efficiency declines when algal blooms are dense (Lathrop, R.C. 1998. Water clarity responses to phosphorus and Daphnia in Lake Mendota. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison.)] Organism densities in number per cubic meter can be obtained by dividing the reported square-meter density by the tow depth, although adjustments for the oxygenated depth zone during the summer and early fall stratified season is required to obtain realistic zooplankton volumetric densities in the lake's surface waters. Biomass densities can be calculated using literature formulas for converting organism body lengths reported in the database to body masses. Sampling Frequency: bi-weekly during ice-free season from late March or early April through early September, then every 4 weeks through late November; sampling is conducted usually once during the winter (depending on ice conditions). Number of sites: 4 Note: for a period between approximately 2011 and 2015, a calculation error caused density values to be significantly greater than they should have been for the entire dataset. That issue has been corrected.},

Ice duration is the number of days that a water body is completely covered with ice and excludes any period during which the lake thawed in mid-winter before freezing again.

Samples are collected as a composite whole-water sample and are preserved in gluteraldehyde. Composite sample depths are 0-8 meters for Lake Mendota (to conform to samples collected and analyzed since 1990 for a UW/DNR food web research study), and 0-2 meters for the other three lakes. A tube sampler is used for the 0-8 m Lake Mendota samples; samples for the other lakes are obtained by collecting water at 1-meter intervals using a Kemmerer water sampler and compositing the samples in a bucket. Samples are taken in the deep hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling. Phytoplankton samples are analyzed by PhycoTech, Inc., a private lab specializing in phytoplankton analyses (see data protocol for procedures). Samples for Wingra and Fish lakes are archived but not routinely counted. Permanent slide mounts (3 per sample) are prepared for all analyzed Mendota and Monona samples as well as 6 samples per year for Wingra and Fish; the slide mounts are archived at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Zoology Museum. Phytoplankton are identified to species using an inverted microscope (Utermohl technique) and are reported as natural unit (i.e., colonies, filaments, or single cells) densities per mL, cell densities per mL, and algal biovolume densities per mL. Multiple entries for the same species on the same date may be due to different variants or vegetative states - (e.g., colonial or attached vs. free cell.) Biovolumes for individual cells of each species are determined during the counting procedure by obtaining cell measurements needed to calculate volumes for geometric solids (e.g., cylinders, spheres, truncated cones) corresponding to actual cell shapes. Biovolume concentrations are then computed by mulitplying the average cell biovolume by the cell densities in the water sample. Note that one million cubicMicrometers of biovolume PerMilliliter of water are equal to a biovolume concentration of one cubicMillimeterPerMilliliter. Assuming a cell density equal to water, a cubicMillimeterPerMilliliter of biovolume converts to a biomass concentration of one milligramPerLiter.

In summary, annual average nighttime low temperatures have increased by 0.6 to 2.2° C, whereas the annual average daytime high temperatures have warmed by 0.3 to 0.6° C. Annual average precipitation has increased by 50-100 mm in the central and southern portions of the state, about a 10-15\% increase, while precipitation across the far northern portion of the state appears to have declined by 20-60 mm since 1950, with the most pronounced decrease occurring during summer. On a seasonal basis, warming temperatures are more pronounced during winter and springtime, and nighttime temperatures are warming faster than daytime high temperatures. Some cooling trends in daytime high temperatures were observed during late summer and fall, particularly in the northeast and far southwest portions of the state. We calculated that the length of the growing season has increased by 5 to 20 days, with the greatest change in the central and northern part of Wisconsin. The annual number of days each year with low temperatures less than 0° F (-17.8° C) has diminished substantially, while the number of days each year with highs greater than 90°F (32.2° C) has remained relatively constant.

            Invasive species impart abrupt changes on ecosystems, but their impacts on microbial communities are often overlooked. We paired a 20-year freshwater microbial community time series with zooplankton and phytoplankton counts, rich environmental data, and a 6-year cyanotoxin time series. We observed strong microbial phenological patterns that were disrupted by the invasions of spiny water flea (
            Bythotrephes longimanus
            ) and zebra mussels (
            Dreissena polymorpha
            ). First, we detected shifts in
            Cyanobacteria
            phenology. After the spiny water flea invasion,
            Cyanobacteria
            dominance crept earlier into clearwater; and after the zebra mussel invasion,
            Cyanobacteria
            abundance crept even earlier into the diatom-dominated spring. During summer, the spiny water flea invasion sparked a cascade of shifting diversity where zooplankton diversity decreased and
            Cyanobacteria
            diversity increased. Second, we detected shifts in cyanotoxin phenology. After the zebra mussel invasion, microcystin increased in early summer and the duration of toxin production increased by over a month. Third, we observed shifts in heterotrophic bacteria phenology. After both invasions, heterotrophic bacteria with putative cyanobacterial associations increased. The
            Bacteroidota
            phylum and members of the acI
            Nanopelagicales
            lineage were differentially more abundant. The diverse summer bacterial community was most resistant to change from the zebra mussel invasion despite the observed shifts in diversity and toxicity during the summer; but the spring and clearwater bacterial communities changed most from the spiny water flea invasion, which lessened clearwater duration and intensity. These long-term invasion-mediated shifts in microbial phenology demonstrate the interconnectedness of microbes with the broader food web, and their susceptibility to long-term environmental change.


            Significance Statement

              Microbial communities are typically studied as part of the microbial loop, separately from the broader food web. Using a two-decade freshwater time series, we explored whether two species invasions that shifted the metazoan food web also impacted the microbial community. We looked for seasonal responses because of strong seasonal patterns within the microbial community. We discovered that
              Cyanobacteria
              increased in the clearwater and spring seasons, and that
              Cyanobacteria
              diversity increased in the summer. Cyanotoxins also increased in early summer, and the duration of toxin production increased. In the heterotrophic bacterial community, many organisms that putatively interact with
              Cyanobacteria
              increased. These findings represent direct observations of long-term bacterial change, and of the interconnectedness of bacteria with the broader food web.},

            Our planet is being subjected to unprecedented climate change, with far-reaching social and ecological repercussions. Below the waterline, aquatic ecosystems are being affected by multiple climate-related and anthropogenic stressors, the combined effects of which are poorly understood and rarely appreciated at the global stage. A striking consequence of climate change on aquatic ecosystems is that many are experiencing shorter periods of ice cover, as well as earlier and longer summer stratified seasons, which often result in a cascade of ecological and environmental consequences, such as warmer summer water temperatures, alterations in lake mixing and water levels, declines in dissolved oxygen, increased likelihood of cyanobacterial algal blooms, and the loss of habitat for native cold-water fisheries. The repercussions of a changing climate include impacts on freshwater supplies, water quality, biodiversity, and the ecosystem benefits that they provide to society.},

Shifts between turbid and clearwater states are well understood for human-impacted shallow lakes, but are not well understood in other types of lakes. Here we use long-term data to describe abrupt shifts in water clarity in Trout Lake, an oligotrophic lake with a largely undeveloped watershed. For several decades mean summer water clarity averaged 4.5 m, but then around 2007 water clarity sharply increased and the “clear water regime” persisted for nearly a decade. Nutrient availability did not explain these changes, but rather they were explained by a classic top-down trophic cascade. Around 2007, the population of the apex pelagic predator, Lake Trout, substantially increased. This was accompanied by a sharp decline in the lake's major pelagic prey fish, the zooplanktivorous Cisco. In turn, there was an increase in large-bodied zooplankton taxa (calanoids, Daphnia), which reduced algal biomass. This clear water regime was then disrupted in 2014 by the invasion of a predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes cederstroemi. This invasion corresponded to strong impacts on lower trophic levels (decrease in large-bodied zooplankton and decreased water clarity), but more minor impacts on higher trophic levels (increased Cisco, decreased Lake Trout abundances)—in effect reversing the trophic cascade and shifting Trout Lake to a novel ecosystem state. Our study provides a long-term, empirically based example of successive ecological regime shifts that occurred from the rise of an apex predator and a mid-trophic level invasion in an undeveloped, oligotrophic lake.},

The spring clear-water phase is a period of marked reduction in algal biomass and increased water transparency observed in many lakes. Here, we quantified the phenological patterns in the start date, maximum date, duration, and magnitude of the clear-water phase over 38 yr in Lakes Mendota and Monona, and examined the effects of water temperature, total phosphorus, and food web structure (proportion of large-bodied Daphnia pulicaria and density of invasive Bythotrephes) and interactions between temperature and other predictors on these clear-water phase metrics. We found that climate and food web structure affected the clear-water phase, but the effects differed among the metrics. Higher water temperature led to earlier clear-water phase start dates and maximum dates in both lakes. The proportion of D. pulicaria affected all clear-water phase metrics in both lakes. When D. pulicaria proportion was higher, the clear-water phase occurred earlier, lasted longer, and the water was clearer. Moreover, high Bythotrephes density delayed clear-water phase start dates (both lakes), and decreased clear-water phase duration (Lake Mendota) in the following year. These results suggest that variation in food web structure changes the full phenological dynamics of the clear-water phase, while variation in climate condition affects clear-water phase timing only. Our findings highlight the importance of large-bodied grazers for managing water quality under climate change.},

We evaluate the economic impacts of an invasion that cascaded through a food web to cause substantial declines in water clarity, a valued ecosystem service. The predatory zooplankton, the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1980s and has subsequently undergone secondary spread to inland lakes, including Lake Mendota (Wisconsin), in 2009. In Lake Mendota, Bythotrephes has reached unparalleled densities compared with in other lakes, decreasing biomass of the grazer Daphnia pulicaria and causing a decline in water clarity of nearly 1 m. Time series modeling revealed that the loss in water clarity, valued at US\$140 million (US\$640 per household), could be reversed by a 71\% reduction in phosphorus loading. A phosphorus reduction of this magnitude is estimated to cost between US\$86.5 million and US\$163 million (US\$430–US\$810 per household). Estimates of the economic effects of Great Lakes invasive species may increase considerably if cases of secondary invasions into inland lakes, such as Lake Mendota, are included. Furthermore, such extreme cases of economic damages call for increased investment in the prevention and control of invasive species to better maximize the economic benefits of such programs. Our results highlight the need to more fully incorporate ecosystem services into our analysis of invasive species impacts, management, and public policy.},

	abstract = {Understanding invasive species spread and projecting how distributions will respond to climate change is a central task for ecologists. Typically, current and projected air temperatures are used to forecast future distributions of invasive species based on climate matching in an ecological niche modeling approach. While this approach was originally developed for terrestrial species, it has also been widely applied to aquatic species even though aquatic species do not experience air temperatures directly. In the case of lakes, species respond to lake thermal regimes, which reflect the interaction of climate and lake attributes such as depth, size, and clarity. The result is that adjacent waterbodies can differ notably in thermal regime. Given these obvious limitations of modeling aquatic species distributions using climate data, we take advantage of recent advances in simulating lake thermal regimes to model the distributions of invasive spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederströmii) for current and projected future climates in the upper Midwest of the USA. We compared predictions and future projections from models based on modeled air temperatures with models based on modeled water temperature. All models predicted that the number of suitable lakes in the region will decrease with climate change. Models based on air and water temperature differed dramatically in the extent of this decrease. The air temperature model predicted 89\% of study lakes to be suitable, with suitability declining dramatically in the late century with climate warming to just a single suitable lake. Lake suitability predictions from the water temperature model declined to a much lesser degree with warming (42\% of lakes were predicted to be suitable, declining to 19\% in the late century) and were more spatially independent. Our results expose the limitations of using air temperatures to model habitat suitability for aquatic species, and our study further highlights the importance of understanding lake-specific responses to climate when assessing aquatic species responses to climate change. While we project a contraction in the potential range of Bythotrephes with warming in the study region, we anticipate that Bythotrephes will likely continue to expand into new lakes that will remain suitable in the following decades.},

	abstract = {Cultural eutrophication of lakes due to excess loading of nutrients is a global problem affecting the provisioning of freshwater ecosystem services. Lake water quality is often described by trophic state indicators such as water clarity or concentrations of nutrients, chlorophyll, and cyanobacteria toxins. While these indicators are widely assumed to covary, capturing the same basic aspects of water quality, they can be uncoupled by changes in lake food webs. Outbreak of the invasive predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes longimanus, in Lakes Mendota and Monona, Wisconsin (U.S.A.) in 2009 led to a decline in the herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, and in turn, water clarity. We use 20-yr datasets for Lakes Mendota and Monona to evaluate interactions among nutrients, zooplankton, and phytoplankton that resulted in this trophic cascade. After invasion, diatoms increased in both lakes resulting in reduced water clarity, whereas cyanobacteria did not change in either lake. Multivariate time series analysis revealed that D. pulicaria grazing controlled edible diatoms in both lakes. Cyanobacteria biomass was positively associated with both D. pulicaria and summer nutrient concentrations. These results further clarify the limitations of top-down control in eutrophic lakes: grazing by zooplankton can control edible phytoplankton taxa, but largely inedible cyanobacteria may be more limited by nutrient concentrations. Accordingly, despite declining clarity in Lake Mendota, the number of beach closures due to cyanobacteria blooms declined following Bythotrephes invasion. Our study reveals how these two indicators of water quality—water clarity and cyanobacteria blooms—can become uncoupled during a food web shift.},

	abstract = {When an invasive species appears at a new location, we typically have no knowledge of the population dynamics leading up to that moment. Is the establishment of invasive propagules closely followed by the appearance of the population? Or alternatively, was there an established low-density population that was released from a constraint and crossed the detection threshold? The early stages of the invasion process are a critical gap in our knowledge, yet vitally important for the detection and management of invasions. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence supporting the lag scenario for an invasive species outbreak. The invasive predatory zooplankton, spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), was detected in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (USA), in summer of 2009 and rapidly reached and sustained exceptionally high densities. To evaluate whether Bythotrephes' outbreak immediately followed introduction or erupted from an established low-density population, we constructed a population model of Bythotrephes in Lake Mendota. In the model, Bythotrephes persisted indefinitely at low levels until favorable thermal conditions in 2009, the coolest July since at least 1895, allowed it to erupt to high densities and establish a large egg bank in the lake sediments. The egg bank stabilized the population in the high-density state despite a return to nonfavorable thermal conditions, which is further supported by demographic data suggesting a constant contribution from the egg bank during the year. The prolonged lag scenario is corroborated by the detection of two individual Bythotrephes in pre-2009 archived samples, and the detection of Bythotrephes spines in lake sediment core layers dating back to 1994 (±5 yr). Together, our results suggest that Bythotrephes persisted for at least a decade below the detection limit, until optimal thermal conditions triggered a population outbreak. This work highlights the potential for environmental conditions to trigger invasive species outbreaks from low-density populations.},

	abstract = {Invasive species impart abrupt changes on ecosystems, but their impacts on microbial communities are often overlooked. We paired a 20-year freshwater microbial community time series with zooplankton and phytoplankton counts, rich environmental data, and a 6-year cyanotoxin time series. We observed strong microbial phenological patterns that were disrupted by the invasions of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). First, we detected shifts in Cyanobacteria phenology. After the spiny water flea invasion, Cyanobacteria dominance crept earlier into clearwater; and after the zebra mussel invasion, Cyanobacteria abundance crept even earlier into the diatom-dominated spring. During summer, the spiny water flea invasion sparked a cascade of shifting diversity where zooplankton diversity decreased and Cyanobacteria diversity increased. Second, we detected shifts in cyanotoxin phenology. After the zebra mussel invasion, microcystin increased in early summer and the duration of toxin production increased by over a month. Third, we observed shifts in heterotrophic bacteria phenology. After both invasions, heterotrophic bacteria with putative cyanobacterial associations increased. The Bacteroidota phylum and members of the acI Nanopelagicales lineage were differentially more abundant. The diverse summer bacterial community was most resistant to change from the zebra mussel invasion despite the observed shifts in diversity and toxicity during the summer; but the spring and clearwater bacterial communities changed most from the spiny water flea invasion, which lessened clearwater duration and intensity. These long-term invasion-mediated shifts in microbial phenology demonstrate the interconnectedness of microbes with the broader food web, and their susceptibility to long-term environmental change.},

	abstract = {Dormant eggs of zooplankton are considered to be tolerant of harsh environmental conditions, yet lethal thresholds of exposure have rarely been determined. We describe 3 yr of dose-response experiments that evaluate hatching success of the resting egg of Bythotrephes longimanus (Cladocera: Cercopagidae) in response to salinity, chlorination, heat, desiccation, and freezing. There was no decline in hatching success in response to salinity (up to 4 weeks at 35 g L−1 salt) or chlorination (including up to 5 min at 3400 mg L−1 chlorine). In response to heat there was an interaction between time and temperature; hatching occurred after exposure to 40°C for 1 min, 5 min, or 10 min but declined with the two longer exposures. Hatching also occurred after exposure to 50°C for 1 min, but no hatching followed exposure to 50°C for 5 min or to higher temperatures for 1 min. In response to desiccation at 17°C, exposure for ≤ 4 h had no effect on hatching but ≥ 6 h resulted in no hatching. When frozen, hatching success depended on whether eggs were frozen in water or without water. Collectively, the results are congruent with an evolutionary origin of B. longimanus in permanent, euryhaline basins. The results advance our understanding of dispersal limits of B. longimanus, including vector potential, and may inform management practices for reducing range expansion of B. longimanus by humans.},

	abstract = {Many coastal marine systems have extensive areas with anoxic sediments and it is not well known how these conditions affect the benthic–pelagic coupling. Zooplankton lay their eggs in the pelagic zone, and some sink and lie dormant in the sediment, before hatched zooplankton return to the water column. In this study, we investigated how oxygenation of long-term anoxic sediments affects the hatching frequency of dormant zooplankton eggs. Anoxic sediments from the brackish Baltic Sea were sampled and incubated for 26 days with constant aeration whereby, the sediment surface and the overlying water were turned oxic. Newly hatched rotifers and copepod nauplii (juveniles) were observed after 5 and 8 days, respectively. Approximately 1.5 × 105 nauplii m−2 emerged from sediment turned oxic compared with 0.02 × 105 m−2 from controls maintained anoxic. This study demonstrated that re-oxygenation of anoxic sediments activated a large pool of buried zooplankton eggs, strengthening the benthic–pelagic coupling of the system. Modelling of the studied anoxic zone suggested that a substantial part of the pelagic copepod population can derive from hatching of dormant eggs. We suggest that this process should be included in future studies to understand population dynamics and carbon flows in marine pelagic systems.},

	abstract = {Human impacts on freshwater ecosystems are pervasive, but the short and discontinuous nature of most datasets limits our ability to understand the controls on water quality and effectively manage freshwater resources. We examine change in Lake Mendota (Madison, Wisconsin) over the last two centuries by pairing analyses of a sedimentary archive with the site's {\textgreater} 100 yr limnological record. We show that eutrophication of the lake, evident as an abrupt shift in sediment composition, began in the late 19th century following the intensification of urban and agricultural land use in the watershed. Efforts to address deterioration of lake water quality, including the removal of point-source pollutants and biomanipulation, have had a measurable influence on sediment composition and water clarity. Since the early 1980s, quasi-seasonal cycles of phytoplankton blooms have induced calcite precipitation, leaving distinct laminations in the sedimentary record. These “whiting events” evidently did not accumulate in lake sediments until the late 20th century, indicating that efforts to remediate water quality have shifted the lake to a new ecosystem state. Calcite whitings can improve water quality in eutrophic lakes by coprecipitation with phosphate, increasing phosphorus (P) burial in lake sediments. Using long-term limnological records, we report negative correlations between calcite saturation indices and P in lake surface waters and show that calcite whitings could partially explain recent P decline in Lake Mendota surface waters. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized potential control on water quality in this eutrophic lake and demonstrates the benefit of coupling long-term limnological data with sedimentary records.},

	abstract = {Trophic cascades can determine the structure of aquatic food webs, a role often used to manage water quality in lakes. However, trophic cascades are subject to multiple interacting drivers of environmental change. For example, invasive species can dramatically alter food webs, though we know less about invasive species effects on managed trophic cascades. Here, we investigate the changing food web dynamics of Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, U.S.A.) over a 40-yr time period. Piscivore stocking (biomanipulation) beginning in 1988 coupled with a 1987 die-off of cisco (the dominant zooplanktivore) led to decreased zooplanktivory that cascaded to increases in the large-bodied herbivorous zooplankton Daphnia pulicaria and greater water clarity. In 2009, the invasive spiny water flea Bythotrephes longimanus was first detected in Lake Mendota and soon reached record densities. As a result of this invasive invertebrate predator, zooplanktivory increased to 47\% of the earlier cisco period. Concomitant with the spiny water flea population explosion were declines in D. pulicaria and water clarity as both exhibited a strong negative relationship to zooplanktivory across the 40-yr time series. We argue that the trophic cascade of 1987–1988 created an environment of high food resources and low fish planktivory that promoted the proliferation of Bythotrephes as it functionally replaced cisco in Lake Mendota's food web. Our results highlight how a manipulated, eutrophic lake was vulnerable to adverse impacts by invasive species, calling attention to the importance of understanding interactions among drivers of environmental change.},

	abstract = {In light of the ongoing spread and adverse impacts of invasive species, there is an urgent need to develop more effective monitoring and management strategies. Such efforts are constrained by our limited capacity to efficiently detect invasive species. Here, we present the case of Bythotrephes longimanus (spiny water flea) invasion into Wisconsin lakes. Detecting Bythotrephes has proven to be challenging due to its capacity to persist at low densities and its highly seasonal population dynamics. We use Bythotrephes to explore detection using three monitoring methods: zooplankton net tows, environmental DNA (eDNA), and sampling of Bythotrephes tail spine subfossils in sediments. Detection probabilities were highly seasonal for both the net tow and eDNA sampling methods—though detections occurred one to two weeks earlier in net tows—and seasonal targeting substantially improved detection by both methods. Conversely, Bythotrephes spine subfossils were found in all 10 lakes with confirmed Bythotrephes populations and in all five samples taken from each lake, except for a single lake where four of the five samples had subfossils. This method was insensitive to seasonally varying population densities as sediments integrate over variation in population densities. In this case, detection and abundance estimation were well covered by sediments and zooplankton nets, respectively, and eDNA provided little additional benefit to surveillance. Our work highlights the importance of choosing methods that address both species life history and monitoring objectives when designing surveillance programs.},

In spring (April–May/June), Bythotrephes longimanus occurs below 0–20 m, while Leptodora is absent. In summer and early autumn (July–September/October), when Leptodora dominates during daytime in the 0–20 m depth, Bythotrephes longimanus also lives in deeper zones. Food competition and fish predation pressure may be the cause of differences in ecology of Leptodora and Bythotrephes acquired during evolution. Due to its transparency and tolerance of higher temperature, Leptodora could avoid fish predation and, therefore, competes with Bythotrephes longimanus successfully. In addition, the differences between the two species may account for the spatial and temporal niche segregation in oligotrophic Swiss Lakes. But spatial niche segregation is less important in mesotrophic lakes with high prey density than in oligotrophic lakes with low prey density. In small, eutrophic lakes importance of temporal niche segregation also decreases, and Bythotrephes is seldom or not present. The preference of Bythotrephes to live in deeper water to avoid fish predation during summer may be the cause of its difficulties to establish itself in small and eutrophic lakes with high prey densities, where the hypolimnion is missing or anoxic.},

However, the impact of oxygen stress on zooplankton, which is the major trophic link between primary producers and fish, remains largely unknown in lakes. Therefore, we studied 41 lakes with different trophic and oxygen conditions to assess the role of oxygen stress on zooplankton communities and carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Samples were collected from each lake at the peak of summer stratification from three depth layers (the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion). Our results revealed that freshwater zooplankton were relatively tolerant to anoxic conditions and the greatest changes in community structure were found in lakes with the highest oxygen deficits. This caused a switch in dominance from large to small species and reduced the zooplankton biomass in lower, anoxic layers of water, but not in the upper layers of water where the oxygen deficits began. This upper anoxic layer could thus be a very important refuge for zooplankton to avoid predation during the day. However, the reduction of zooplankton in the lower water layers was the main factor that reduced the effectiveness of carbon transfer between the phytoplankton and zooplankton.},

Although proximal control over lake DO can be attributed to metabolism and physical processes, how those processes evolve over decades largely remains unexplored. Metabolism phenology may reveal the importance of coherence among lakes and facilitate general conclusions about the controls on lake metabolism at regional scales. We developed a Bayesian modeling framework to estimate DO concentrations and metabolism in eight lakes in contrasting landscapes in Wisconsin, USA. We identify the DO and metabolism phenologies for each lake, and use those to compare how decadal patterns relate to trophic state and landscape setting. We show that lakes can be categorized by their hypolimnetic oxygen consumption dynamics, with oligotrophic lakes having a diverse set of patterns and eutrophic lakes having uniform trends of increased oxygen consumption over the last decade. Metabolism phenology is likewise diverse for oligotrophic lakes, whereas eutrophic lakes in southern Wisconsin share consistent long-term patterns of metabolic trends and seasonal DO consumption highlighting the importance of trophic state driving metabolism. Eutrophic lakes had higher magnitudes and more seasonal variation in net ecosystem production in contrast to oligotrophic lakes. Generally, long-term metabolic trends of north temperate lakes suggest a limited influence of climate on lake metabolism and that temporal coherence of long-term metabolism change is driven primarily by the landscape setting.},

	abstract = {Single-lake studies offer an opportunity for understanding, predicting, and mitigating local or regional threats to lake ecosystems. Our goal was to understand how concurrent environmental stressors such as climate change, eutrophication, and salinization affect long-term lake water quality. We report epilimnetic changes in 18 water-quality parameters collected at seven sites from 1980 to 2016 in Lake George, a large oligotrophic lake in the Adirondack Park, New York, USA. Improvements and deteriorations in water quality occurred over 37 years. We observed a 32\% increase in chlorophyll a associated with an increase in orthophosphate, but not total phosphorus or a warming epilimnion (0.05°C/year). Salinization from road deicing salts contributed to the largest deterioration in water quality. However, chloride concentrations and the current rate of increase are low enough that few ecological impacts are likely to occur over the next few decades. Increasing calcium concentrations were not high enough to facilitate the persistence of invasive species in the lake such as zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) but are sufficient for Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) and the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus). Similar to other lakes, environmental legislation has supported recovery from acidification, indicated by reduced sulfate and nitrate, and increased alkalinity and pH. Declines in water quality were minor relative to other lakes, suggesting that decades of tourism and development occurred without major deterioration in water quality, but management efforts are needed to curb salinization in the Lake George watershed, particularly as it relates to sodium concentrations to prevent a loss of drinking water quality.},

We used a combination of uni- and multivariate analyses to examine variation in Bythotrephes interannual and seasonal abundance, and life-history characteristics in Lake Simcoe from 1999 to 2007, and we explored the biotic (predators, prey) and/or abiotic (water quality, temperature) factors that may have regulated its population over this period. The mean annual abundance of Bythotrephes varied by an order of magnitude over the period of study and was significantly associated with epilimnetic temperature and prey and predator abundance. Bythotrephes typically appeared in early summer and had 2 seasonal abundance peaks, which varied in magnitude and timing within and among years. August and September Secchi depth and total phosphorus concentration predicted groups of years with similar Bythotrephes phenologies, lending further support to the role of water clarity as a significant component of this visual predator’s habitat in its invaded range. Bythotrephes body size and reproductive patterns also varied seasonally, possibly reflecting the seasonal availability of cladoceran prey, predation pressure from planktivorous fish, or adaptations to avoid unfavourable conditions. Overall, a complex interaction of fish predation, food availability, temperature, and water clarity controlled the dynamics of Bythotrephes in Lake Simcoe. Changes to the Lake Simcoe ecosystem due to Bythotrephes invasion may have important consequences for the ecosystem services provided by the lake and merit further investigation.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) loading to lakes is degrading the quality and usability of water globally. Accurate predictions of lake P dynamics are needed to understand whole-ecosystem P budgets, as well as the consequences of changing lake P concentrations for water quality. However, complex biophysical processes within lakes, along with limited observational data, challenge our capacity to reproduce short-term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions, as well as long-term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake P. Here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling, process-guided machine learning (PGML), to produce a phosphorus budget for Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades. In our implementation of PGML, which we term a Process-Guided Recurrent Neural Network (PGRNN), we combine a process-based model for lake P with a recurrent neural network, and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles. We test independently the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN to evaluate the overall approach. The process-based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake P; however it missed the long-term trend in lake P and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer P in surface waters. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN was 33.0 μg P L−1, 22.7 μg P L−1, and 20.7 μg P L−1, respectively. All models performed better during summer, with RMSE values for the three models (same order) equal to 14.3 μg P L−1, 10.9 μg P L−1, and 10.7 μg P L−1. Although the PGRNN had only marginally better RMSE during summer, it had lower bias and reproduced long-term decreases in lake P missed by the other two models. For all seasons and all years, the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.8 μg P L−1 and 28.0 μg P L−1, respectively. The output of PGRNN indicated that new processes related to water temperature, thermal stratification, and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model. By using ecological knowledge, as well as the information content of complex data, PGML shows promise as a technique for accurate prediction in messy, real-world ecological dynamics, while providing valuable information that can improve our understanding of process.},

	abstract = {In the context-dependent world of biological invasions, biologists understand few general patterns of spread and impact. One possible exception is the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), an invader that routinely restructures food webs through an ecosystem engineering process termed “benthification.” By efficiently consuming phytoplankton, zebra mussels can increase light penetration and nutrient concentrations in the benthos of a lake, thereby stimulating growth of benthic periphyton (phytobenthos) and macroinvertebrates (zoobenthos). Few studies monitor the response of these benthic communities to invasion. We documented early changes in phytobenthos and zoobenthos as zebra mussels invaded eutrophic Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA). From 2015 to 2018, the number of zebra mussel individuals reached densities {\textgreater}30 000 m−2 on hard substrates and 3000 m−2 in macrophyte beds. Community data showed classic signs of benthification, including 300\% increases in (non-zebra mussel) zoobenthos and phytobenthos abundance on average across a depth gradient, including significant increases at depths where zebra mussels did colonize. Deep macrophyte biomass increased 900\%, but water clarity showed no significant rapid increase. We speculate that nutrient enrichment may be more strongly responsible than increased light penetration for the benthic response of Lake Mendota. Continued integration of benthic production and processes into our study of lake ecosystems will be critical to understanding whole ecosystem function, especially as zebra mussels continue to “benthify” lakes within their invaded range.},

	abstract = {Our changing climate is having effects on freshwater ecosystems in all seasons, especially winter. High latitude lakes, wetlands, and rivers are experiencing shorter periods of ice cover, and lower latitudes systems that used to freeze are experiencing open water conditions throughout the winter. A 2019 AGU Chapman conference convened aquatic scientists to examine these changes and address the implications of changing winters to aquatic life, chemistry, and physics. Several studies demonstrate decreased ice cover duration than in the past. The removal of an ice “lid” from lakes and rivers impacts the exchange of gases with the atmosphere and the predominant types of metabolism occurring in the waters below, with the potential for more photosynthesis and an increase in oxic versus anoxic metabolism when the lid is removed. Multiple studies indicated an increase in the interannual variability of winters, especially in terms of ice-cover duration and ice quality. Increased variability may simply be an outcome of a more variable winter climate or small differences in environmental conditions such as temperature that can have strong effects on gas exchange, light transmission, and turbulence when ice forms. A question that merits further consideration is whether and how winters of shorter duration and severity will change the dynamics of freshwater systems. Are there memory or legacy effects that carry over to the next season or year? There is much work to be done to understand how changing winters will impact the biogeochemical behavior of lakes and rivers in the coming decades.},

Here, we updated ice phenology records for 60 lakes with time-series ranging from 107–204 years to provide the first re-assessment of Northern Hemispheric ice trends since 2004 by adding 15 additional years of ice phenology records and 40 lakes to our study. We found that, on average, ice-on was 11.0 days later, ice-off was 6.8 days earlier, and ice duration was 17.0 days shorter per century over the entire record for each lake. Trends in ice-on and ice duration were six times faster in the last 25-year period (1992–2016) than previous quarter centuries. More extreme events in recent decades, including late ice-on, early ice-off, shorter periods of ice cover, or no ice cover at all, contribute to the increasing rate of lake ice loss. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could limit increases in air temperature and abate losses in lake ice cover that would subsequently limit ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic consequences, such as increased evaporation rates, warmer water temperatures, degraded water quality, and the formation of toxic algal blooms.},

This study uses 3510 time series from across 678 Northern Hemisphere lakes and rivers to explore historical patterns in lake and river ice phenology across five overlapping time periods (1931–1960, 1946–1975, 1961–1990, 1976–2005, and 1931–2005). These time series show that the number of annual open-water days increased by 0.63 d per decade from 1931–2005 across the Northern Hemisphere, with trends for breakup and, to a lesser extent, freeze-up closely correlating with regionally averaged temperature. Breakup and freeze-up trends display a spatiotemporally complex evolution and reveal considerable caveats with interpreting the implications of ice phenology changes at lake and river sites that may only have breakup or freeze-up data, rather than both. These results provide an important contribution by showing regional variation in ice phenology trends through time that can be hidden by longer-term trends. The overlapping 30-year time periods also show evidence for an acceleration in warming trends through time. Understanding the changes on both long- and short-term timescales will be important for determining the causes of this change, the underlying biogeochemical processes associated with it, and the wider climatological significance as global temperatures rise.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Both increases and decreases of phytoplankton biomass after storms have been observed, but the precise mechanisms driving these responses remain poorly understood or quantified. In this study, we coupled a one-dimensional physical model to a biogeochemical model to investigate the factors regulating short-term phytoplankton responses to summer storms, now and under expected warmer future conditions. We simulated physical, chemical and biological dynamics in Lake Erken, Sweden, and found that wind storms could increase or decrease the phytoplankton concentration one week after the storm, depending on antecedent lake physical and chemical conditions. Storms had little effect on phytoplankton biomass if the mixed layer was deep prior to storm exposure. Higher incoming shortwave radiation and hypolimnetic nutrient concentration boosted growth, whereas higher surface water temperatures decreased phytoplankton concentration after storms. Medium-intensity wind speeds resulted in more phytoplankton biomass after storms than high-intensity wind. Simulations under a future climate scenario did not show marked differences in the way wind affects phytoplankton growth following storms. Our study shows that storm impacts on lake phytoplankton are complex and likely to vary as a function of local environmental conditions.},

While phytoplankton seasonal succession within a year has been described for many lakes, much less is known about variability in seasonal succession over multiple years. Here, we describe how continuous wavelet transforms can be used to identify variation in the periodicity in phytoplankton time series at multiple timescales. To demonstrate our approach, we analyzed 16 years of biweekly phytoplankton data from eutrophic Lake Mendota, USA, that coincided with substantial variability in climate and nutrient loading. Throughout the time series, the wavelet transforms identified the annual scale as the dominant scale of variation in aggregated phytoplankton, except for a 3-year period when there was no significant dominant scale. This period coincided with drought and decreased nutrient loading. During this time, phytoplankton biomass was markedly lower, and the phytoplankton community exhibited a unimodal, not bimodal, pattern of seasonal succession. Our results highlight the utility of wavelet techniques for identifying changes in seasonal succession in long-term phytoplankton records, which are becoming more available for many lakes. As aquatic ecosystems increasingly experience exogenous forcings at multiple timescales, wavelet analyses provide a powerful tool for determining how phytoplankton communities may respond.},

However, very little is known about lake heatwaves—periods of extreme warm lake surface water temperature—and how they may change under global warming. Here we use satellite observations and a numerical model to investigate changes in lake heatwaves for hundreds of lakes worldwide from 1901 to 2099. We show that lake heatwaves will become hotter and longer by the end of the twenty-first century. For the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), the average intensity of lake heatwaves, defined relative to the historical period (1970 to 1999), will increase from 3.7 ± 0.1 to 5.4 ± 0.8 degrees Celsius and their average duration will increase dramatically from 7.7 ± 0.4 to 95.5 ± 35.3 days. In the low-greenhouse-gas-emission RCP 2.6 scenario, heatwave intensity and duration will increase to 4.0 ± 0.2 degrees Celsius and 27.0 ± 7.6 days, respectively. Surface heatwaves are longer-lasting but less intense in deeper lakes (up to 60 metres deep) than in shallower lakes during both historic and future periods. As lakes warm during the twenty-first century7,8, their heatwaves will begin to extend across multiple seasons, with some lakes reaching a permanent heatwave state. Lake heatwaves are likely to exacerbate the adverse effects of long-term warming in lakes and exert widespread influence on their physical structure and chemical properties. Lake heatwaves could alter species composition by pushing aquatic species and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience. This in turn could threaten lake biodiversity9 and the key ecological and economic benefits that lakes provide to society.},

	abstract = {Inland lakes are socially and ecologically important components of many regional landscapes. Exploring lake responses to plausible future climate scenarios can provide important information needed to inform stakeholders of likely effects of hydrologic changes on these waterbodies in coming decades. To assess potential climate effects on lake hydrology, we combined a previously published spatially explicit, processed-based hydrologic modeling framework implemented over the lake-rich landscape of the Northern Highlands Lake District within the United States with an ensemble of climate change scenarios for the 2050s (2041–2070) and 2080s (2071–2100). Model results quantify the effects of climate change on water budgets and lake stage elevations for 3692 lakes and highlight the importance of landscape and hydrologic setting for the response of specific lake types to climate change. All future climate projections resulted in loss of ice cover and snowpack as well as increased evaporation, but variability in climate projections (warmer conditions, wet winters combined with wet or dry summers) interacted with lake characteristics and landscape position to produce variable lake hydrologic changes. Water levels for drainage lakes (lakes with substantial surface water inflows and outflows) showed nearly no change, whereas minimum water levels for seepage lakes (minimal surface water fluxes) decreased by an average of up to 2.64 m by the end of the 21st century. Our physically based modeling approach is parsimonious and computationally efficient and can be applied to other lake-rich regions to investigate interregional variability in lake hydrologic response to future climate scenarios.},

However, from 2006 to 2099, the velocity of climate change will increase to 8.7 ± 5.5 km per decade under a low-emission pathway such as Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 or 57.0 ± 17.0 km per decade under a high-emission pathway such as RCP 8.5, meaning that the thermal habitat in inland standing waters will move faster than the ability of some species to disperse to cooler areas. The fragmented distribution of standing waters in a landscape will restrict redistribution, even for species with high dispersal ability, so that the negative consequences of rapid warming for freshwater species are likely to be much greater than in terrestrial and marine realms.},

              600
              ) usually derived from wind speed. The great heterogeneity of aquatic systems raises questions about the appropriateness of using a single wind-based model to predict k
              600
              in all aquatic systems. Theoretical considerations suggest that wind speed to k

Hence, convective processes are often the dominant drivers for shaping mixing and stratification structures in inland waters. Due to the diverse environments of lakes—defined by local morphological, geochemical, and meteorological conditions, among others—a fascinating variety of convective processes can develop with remarkably unique signatures. Whereas the classical cooling-induced and shear-induced convections are well-known phenomena due to their dominant roles in ocean basins, other convective processes are specific to lakes and often overlooked, for example, sidearm, under-ice, and double-diffusive convection or thermobaric instability and bioconvection. Additionally, the peculiar properties of the density function at low salinities/temperatures leave distinctive traces. In this review, we present these various processes and connect observations with theories and model results.},

All prognostic variables are treated in a unified manner via a generic 1-D transport equation for horizontally averaged property. A water body interacts with underlying sediments. These sediments are represented by a set of vertical columns with heat, moisture and CH4 transport inside. The model is validated vs. a comprehensive observational data set gathered at Kuivajärvi Lake (southern Finland), demonstrating a fair agreement. The value of a key calibration constant, regulating the magnitude of methane production in sediments, corresponded well to that obtained from another two lakes. We demonstrated via surface seiche parameterization that the near-bottom turbulence induced by surface seiches is likely to significantly affect CH4 accumulation there. Furthermore, our results suggest that a gas transfer through thermocline under intense internal seiche motions is a bottleneck in quantifying greenhouse gas dynamics in dimictic lakes, which calls for further research.},

hydrodynamic-ecological lake model
DYRESM-CAEDYM, using a Monte Carlo sampling (MCS) method, in order to test
the applicability of this procedure for shallow, polymictic Lake Rotorua (New
Zealand). The calibration procedure involved independently minimizing the
root-mean-square error (RMSE), maximizing the Pearson correlation coefficient
(r) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficient coefficient (Nr) for comparisons
of model state variables against measured data. An assigned number of
parameter permutations was used for 10 000 simulation iterations. The
“optimal” temperature calibration produced a RMSE of 0.54 ∘C,
Nr value of 0.99, and r value of 0.98 through the whole water
column based on comparisons with 540 observed water temperatures collected
between 13 July 2007 and 13 January 2009. The modeled bottom dissolved oxygen
concentration (20.5 m below surface) was compared with 467 available
observations. The calculated RMSE of the simulations compared with the
measurements was 1.78 mg L−1, the Nr value was 0.75, and the
r value was 0.87. The autocalibrated model was further tested for an
independent data set by simulating bottom-water hypoxia events from 15
January 2009 to 8 June 2011 (875 days). This verification produced an
accurate simulation of five hypoxic events corresponding to
DO {\textless} 2 mg L−1 during summer of 2009–2011. The RMSE was
2.07 mg L−1, Nr value 0.62, and r value of 0.81, based on
the available data set of 738 days. The autocalibration software of
DYRESM-CAEDYM developed here is substantially less time-consuming and more
efficient in parameter optimization than traditional manual calibration which
has been the standard tool practiced for similar complex water quality
models.},

              The interaction between large inland water bodies and the atmosphere impacts the evolution of regional weather and climate, which in turn affects the lake dynamics, thermodynamics, ice-formation, and, therefore, ecosystems. Over the last decades, various approaches have been used to model lake thermodynamics and dynamics in standalone mode or coupled to numerical atmospheric models. We assess a turbulence-closure

              multi-column lake model in standalone mode as a computationally-efficient alternative to a full three-dimensional hydrodynamic model in the case of Lake Geneva. While it struggles to reproduce some short-term features, the multi-column model reasonably reproduces the seasonal mean of the thermal horizontal and vertical structures governing heat and mass exchanges between the lake surface and the lower atmosphere (stratified period, thermocline depth, stability of the water column). As it requires typically two orders of magnitude less computational ressources, it may allow a two-way coupling with a RCM on timescales or spatial resolutions where full 3D lake models are too demanding.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The gas transfer velocity (k) is a major source of uncertainty when assessing the magnitude of lake gas exchange with the atmosphere. For the
diversity of existing empirical and process-based k models, the transfer velocity increases with the level of turbulence near the air–water
interface. However, predictions for k can vary by a factor of 2 among different models. Near-surface turbulence results from the action of wind
shear, surface waves, and buoyancy-driven convection. Wind shear has long been identified as a key driver, but recent lake studies have shifted the
focus towards the role of convection, particularly in small lakes. In large lakes, wind fetch can, however, be long enough to generate surface waves
and contribute to enhance gas transfer, as widely recognised in oceanographic studies. Here, field values for gas transfer velocity were computed in
a large hard-water lake, Lake Geneva, from CO2 fluxes measured with an automated (forced diffusion) flux chamber and CO2 partial
pressure measured with high-frequency sensors. k estimates were compared to a set of reference limnological and oceanic k models. Our analysis
reveals that accounting for surface waves generated during windy events significantly improves the accuracy of k estimates in this large lake. The
improved k model is then used to compute k over a 1-year time period. Results show that episodic extreme events with surface waves (6 \%
occurrence, significant wave height {\textgreater} 0.4 m) can generate more than 20 \% of annual cumulative k and more than 25 \% of annual
net CO2 fluxes in Lake Geneva. We conclude that for lakes whose fetch can exceed 15 km, k models need to integrate the effect of
surface waves.},

	abstract = {A common perception in limnology is that shallow lakes are homogeneously mixed owing to their small water volume. However, this perception is largely gained by downscaling knowledge from large lakes to their smaller counterparts. Here we show that shallow vegetated lakes (less than 0.6 m), in fact, undergo recurring daytime stratification and nocturnal mixing accompanied by extreme chemical variations during summer. Dense submerged vegetation effectively attenuates light and turbulence generating separation between warm surface waters and much colder bottom waters. Photosynthesis in surface waters produces oxygen accumulation and CO
              2
              depletion, whereas respiration in dark bottom waters causes anoxia and CO
              2
              accumulation. High daytime pH in surface waters promotes precipitation of CaCO
              3
              which is re-dissolved in bottom waters. Nocturnal convective mixing re-introduces oxygen into bottom waters for aerobic respiration and regenerated inorganic carbon into surface waters, which supports intense photosynthesis. Our results reconfigure the basic understanding of local environmental gradients in shallow lakes, one of the most abundant freshwater habitats globally.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the effects of littoral submerged macrophytes on weak stratification conditions in a small and shallow lake are investigated. Diverse submerged macrophytes occupying a large portion of the littoral zone act as resistance to water motions and affect lake hydrodynamics. Strong solar radiation and mild wind forcing typically occurring during the summer season result in weak stratification characterized by a diurnal cycle with a temperature differential of 1–3 °C. Temperature and circulation dynamics of a small and shallow lake are depicted by extensive field measurements and a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model with a generic length scale (GLS) approach for the turbulence closure and drag forces induced by macrophytes. Results show that the effects of macrophytes on velocity profiles are apparent. In the pelagic area, the circulation patterns with and without macrophytes are similar. The velocity profile is generally characterized by a two-layer structure with the maximum velocity at both the water surface and the mid-depth. In contrast, inside the littoral zone, the mean flow is retarded by macrophytes and the velocity profile is changed to only one maximum velocity at the surface with a steeper decrease until 2.0 m depth and another slight decrease to the lake bottom. From the whole lake perspective, littoral macrophytes dampen the horizontal water temperature difference between the upwind side and download side of the lake. Macrophytes promote a stronger temperature stratification by retarding mean flows and reducing vertical mixing. Overall, this study shows that the temperature structures and circulation patterns under weak stratification conditions in a small and shallow lake are strongly affected by littoral vegetation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Global change is influencing production and respiration in ecosystems across the globe. Lakes in particular are changing in response to climatic variability and cultural eutrophication, resulting in changes in ecosystem metabolism. Although the primary drivers of production and respiration such as the availability of nutrients, light, and carbon are well known, heterogeneity in hydrologic setting (for example, hydrological connectivity, morphometry, and residence) across and within regions may lead to highly variable responses to the same drivers of change, complicating our efforts to predict these responses. We explored how differences in hydrologic setting among lakes influenced spatial and inter annual variability in ecosystem metabolism, using high-frequency oxygen sensor data from 11 lakes over 8 years. Trends in mean metabolic rates of lakes generally followed gradients of nutrient and carbon concentrations, which were lowest in seepage lakes, followed by drainage lakes, and higher in bog lakes. We found that while ecosystem respiration (ER) was consistently higher in wet years in all hydrologic settings, gross primary production (GPP) only increased in tandem in drainage lakes. However, interannual rates of ER and GPP were relatively stable in drainage lakes, in contrast to seepage and bog lakes which had coefficients of variation in metabolism between 22–32\%. We explored how the geospatial context of lakes, including hydrologic residence time, watershed area to lake area, and landscape position influenced the sensitivity of individual lake responses to climatic variation. We propose a conceptual framework to help steer future investigations of how hydrologic setting mediates the response of metabolism to climatic variability.},

              concentration and primary production carried out in the Ría de Vigo (NW Iberian upwelling system) between March 2017 and May 2018 to investigate the relationship between turbulent mixing and phytoplankton growth at different temporal scales. In order to interpret our results, we used the theoretical framework described by the Critical Turbulent Hypothesis (CTH). According to this conceptual model if turbulence is low enough, the depth of the layer where mixing is active can be shallower than the mixed-layer depth, and phytoplankton may receive enough light to bloom. Our results showed that the coupling between turbulent mixing and phytoplankton growth in this system occurs at seasonal, but also at shorter time scales. In agreement with the CTH, higher phytoplankton growth rates were observed when mixing was low during spring-summer transitional and upwelling periods, whereas low values were described during periods of high mixing (fall-winter transitional and downwelling). However, low mixing conditions were not enough to ensure phytoplankton growth, as low phytoplankton growth was also found under these circumstances. Wavelet spectral analysis revealed that turbulent mixing and phytoplankton growth were also related at shorter time scales. The higher coherence between both variables was found in spring-summer at the {\textasciitilde}16–30 d period and in fall-winter at the {\textasciitilde}16–90 d period. These results suggest that mixing could act as a control factor on phytoplankton growth over the seasonal cycle, and could be also involved in the formation of occasional short-lived phytoplankton blooms.},

	abstract = {Eutrophication increases hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs, causing deleterious effects on biological communities. Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

More intense cooling, indeed, accelerates the rate of decrease of lake surface water temperature (LSWT), while stronger wind deepens the surface layer, increasing the heat capacity, and thus reduces the rate of decrease of LSWT. A statistical characterization of the process is obtained with a Monte Carlo simulation considering random sequences of the energy fluxes. The results, interpreted through an approximate analytical solution of the minimal model, elucidate the general tendency of the system, suggesting a power-law dependence of the pre-freezing duration on the energy fluxes.

              Prochlorococcus
              . To understand what drove observed evolutionary patterns, we interpreted them in the context of its population dynamics, growth rate, and light adaptation, and the size and macromolecular and elemental composition of cells. This multilevel view suggests that, over the course of evolution, there was a steady increase in
              Prochlorococcus
              ’ metabolic rate and excretion of organic carbon. We derived a mathematical framework that suggests these adaptations lower the minimal subsistence nutrient concentration of cells, which results in a drawdown of nutrients in oceanic surface waters. This, in turn, increases total ecosystem biomass and promotes the coevolution of all cells in the ecosystem. Additional reconstructions suggest that
              Prochlorococcus
              and the dominant cooccurring heterotrophic bacterium SAR11 form a coevolved mutualism that maximizes their collective metabolic rate by recycling organic carbon through complementary excretion and uptake pathways. Moreover, the metabolic codependencies of
              Prochlorococcus
              and SAR11 are highly similar to those of chloroplasts and mitochondria within plant cells. These observations lead us to propose a general theory relating metabolic evolution to the self-amplification and self-organization of the biosphere. We discuss the implications of this framework for the evolution of Earth’s biogeochemical cycles and the rise of atmospheric oxygen.},

A grand challenge is to use these data to improve predictive models and use models to explain observed patterns. This article presents a framework that aligns observations and models along the dimension of abstraction or biological organization—from raw sequences to ecosystem patterns for observations, and from sequence simulators to ecological theory for models. It then reviews 16 studies that compared model results with molecular observations. Molecular data can and are being combined with microbial ecosystem models, but to keep up with and take advantage of the full scope of observations, models need to become more mechanistically detailed and complex, which is a technical and cultural challenge for the ecological modeling community.},

            Individual-based models, ‘IBMs’, describe naturally the dynamics of interacting organisms or social or financial agents. They are considered too complex for mathematical analysis, but computer simulations of them cannot give the general insights required. Here, we resolve this problem with a general mathematical framework for IBMs containing interactions of an unlimited level of complexity, and derive equations that reliably approximate the effects of space and stochasticity. We provide software, specified in an accessible and intuitive graphical way, so any researcher can obtain analytical and simulation results for any particular IBM without algebraic manipulation. We illustrate the framework with examples from movement ecology, conservation biology, and evolutionary ecology. This framework will provide unprecedented insights into a hitherto intractable panoply of complex models across many scientific fields.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Lake Tanganyika (LT) is the largest tropical freshwater lake, and the largest body of anoxic freshwater on Earth’s surface. LT’s mixed oxygenated surface waters float atop a permanently anoxic layer and host rich animal biodiversity. However, little is known about microorganisms inhabiting LT’s 1470 meter deep water column and their contributions to nutrient cycling, which affect ecosystem-level function and productivity. Here, we applied genome-resolved metagenomics and environmental analyses to link specific taxa to key biogeochemical processes across a vertical depth gradient in LT. We reconstructed 523 unique metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 34 bacterial and archaeal phyla, including many rarely observed in freshwater lakes. We identified sharp contrasts in community composition and metabolic potential with an abundance of typical freshwater taxa in oxygenated mixed upper layers, and Archaea and uncultured Candidate Phyla in deep anoxic waters. Genomic capacity for nitrogen and sulfur cycling was abundant in MAGs recovered from anoxic waters, highlighting microbial contributions to the productive surface layers via recycling of upwelled nutrients, and greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide. Overall, our study provides a blueprint for incorporation of aquatic microbial genomics in the representation of tropical freshwater lakes, especially in the context of ongoing climate change, which is predicted to bring increased stratification and anoxia to freshwater lakes.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Lake Lanier is an important freshwater lake for the southeast United States, as it represents the main source of drinking water for the Atlanta metropolitan area and is popular for recreational activities. Temperate freshwater lakes such as Lake Lanier are underrepresented among the growing number of environmental metagenomic data sets, and little is known about how functional gene content in freshwater communities relates to that of other ecosystems. To better characterize the gene content and variability of this freshwater planktonic microbial community, we sequenced several samples obtained around a strong summer storm event and during the fall water mixing using a random whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approach. Comparative metagenomics revealed that the gene content was relatively stable over time and more related to that of another freshwater lake and the surface ocean than to soil. However, the phylogenetic diversity of Lake Lanier communities was distinct from that of soil and marine communities. We identified several important genomic adaptations that account for these findings, such as the use of potassium (as opposed to sodium) osmoregulators by freshwater organisms and differences in the community average genome size. We show that the lake community is predominantly composed of sequence-discrete populations and describe a simple method to assess community complexity based on population richness and evenness and to determine the sequencing effort required to cover diversity in a sample. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity and metabolic potential of a temperate planktonic freshwater community and advances approaches for comparative metagenomics.},

            Nearly 30 years ago, emerged the concept of deterministic chaos. With it came sensitivity to initial conditions, nonlinearities, and strange attractors. This constituted a paradigm shift that profoundly altered how numerical modellers approached dynamic systems. It also provided an opportunity to resolve a situation of mutual misunderstanding between scientists and non-scientists about uncertainties and predictability in natural systems. Our proposition is that this issue can be addressed in an original way which involves modelling based on the principles of chance and necessity (CaN). We outline the conceptual and mathematical principles of CaN models and present an application of the model to the Barents Sea food-web. Because CaN models rely on concepts easily grasped by all actors, because they are explicit about knowns and unknowns and because the interpretation of their results is simple without being prescriptive, they can be used in a context of participatory management. We propose that, three decades after the emergence of chaos theories, CaN can be a practical step to reconcile scientists and non-scientists around the modelling of structurally and dynamically complex natural systems, and significantly contribute to ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The epilimnion is the surface layer of a lake typically characterised as well mixed and is decoupled from the metalimnion due to a steep change in density. The concept of the epilimnion (and, more widely, the three-layered structure of a stratified lake) is fundamental in limnology, and calculating the depth of the epilimnion is essential to understanding many physical and ecological lake processes. Despite the ubiquity of the term, however, there is no objective or generic approach for defining the epilimnion, and a diverse number of approaches prevail in the literature. Given the increasing availability of water temperature and density profile data from lakes with a high spatio-temporal resolution, automated calculations, using such data, are particularly common, and they have vast potential for use with evolving long-term globally measured and modelled datasets. However, multi-site and multi-year studies, including those related to future climate impacts, require robust and automated algorithms for epilimnion depth estimation. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive comparison of commonly used epilimnion depth estimation methods, using a combined 17-year dataset, with over 4700 daily temperature profiles from two European lakes. Overall, we found a very large degree of variability in the estimated epilimnion depth across all methods and thresholds investigated and for both lakes. These differences, manifesting over high-frequency data, led to fundamentally different understandings of the epilimnion depth. In addition, estimations of the epilimnion depth were highly sensitive to small changes in the threshold value, complex thermal water column structures, and vertical data resolution. These results call into question the custom of arbitrary method selection and the potential problems this may cause for studies interested in estimating the ecological processes occurring within the epilimnion, multi-lake comparisons, or long-term time series analysis. We also identified important systematic differences between methods, which demonstrated how and why methods diverged. These results may provide rationale for future studies to select an appropriate epilimnion definition in light of their particular purpose and with awareness of the limitations of individual methods. While there is no prescribed rationale for selecting a particular method, the method which defined the epilimnion depth as the shallowest depth, where the density was 0.1 kg m−3 more than the surface density, may be particularly useful as a generic method.},

	abstract = {Abstract. One-dimensional hydrodynamic models are nowadays widely recognized as key
tools for lake studies. They offer the possibility to analyze processes at
high frequency, here referring to hourly timescales, to investigate
scenarios and test hypotheses. Yet, simulation outputs are mainly used by
the modellers themselves and often not easily reachable for the outside
community. We have developed an open-access web-based platform for
visualization and promotion of easy access to lake model output data updated
in near-real time (http://simstrat.eawag.ch, last access: 29 August 2019). This platform was developed for 54
lakes in Switzerland with potential for adaptation to other regions or at
global scale using appropriate forcing input data. The benefit of this data
platform is practically illustrated with two examples. First, we show that
the output data allows for assessing the long-term effects of past climate
change on the thermal structure of a lake. The study confirms the need to
not only evaluate changes in all atmospheric forcing but also changes in the
watershed or throughflow heat energy and changes in light penetration to
assess the lake thermal structure. Then, we show how the data platform can
be used to study and compare the role of episodic strong wind events for
different lakes on a regional scale and especially how their thermal
structure is temporarily destabilized. With this open-access data platform,
we demonstrate a new path forward for scientists and practitioners promoting
a cross exchange of expertise through openly sharing in situ and model
data.},

This paper shows a simple method to estimate the environmental pressure from the deicing of roads as steady state chloride concentration in water. The data processed are presented using GIS. The result showed that the contribution of deicing salt is of importance for the chloride concentration on a regional scale. The increase in chloride concentration is also compared to the background concentration and other sources of chloride within the river basin. Road salt applied by the Swedish National Road Administration (SNRA) accounts for more than half of the total chloride load for the river basin investigated. The method presented may easily be generalised to a national scale for monitoring the environmental effects of deicing salt application.},

	abstract = {Ides Cove is a small, relatively deep, isolated body of water adjoining Irondequoit Bay of Lake Ontario, Irondequoit, N.Y. In 1970–1971, the cove was meromictic with meromixis being attributed to the heavy application of delcing salts in the cove's watershed. Application of deicing salts to roads in the Town of Irondequoit has steadily declined from {\textgreater} 31,000 metric tons in 1970–1971 to {\textless} 4,000 tons in 1979–1980. The resultant decrease in salt concentrations of the surface waters of the cove since 1970 is evidence of recovery from meromixis. Also, complete mixing of the water column observed during the winter of 1979–1980 suggests that the town's “sensible salt use policy” has been a success. However, Cl− concentrations and conductivity in the hypolimnion during the spring, summer, and autumn have remained high due primarily to the discharge of naturally occurring salt from groundwater streams (mean annual Cl− = 303 mg/1) into the cove. The addition of naturally occurring salt into the cove currently affects mixing patterns by suppressing the autumn and spring turnover and probably affected mixing patterns in a similar manner prior to the advent of deicing operations.},

Chloride level measured in spring water was far more seasonally stable than that measured in surface (river) water, and thus the spatial pattern of Cl contamination indicated by the former was judged to be more reliable. Chloride contamination of groundwater in the GTA was strongly related to urbanisation, and at the four most affected springs increases of between 21 and 34\% were detected over the period November 1996 to November 1997. The response of macroinvertebrates living in these springs to increasing salinity was examined with the aim of creating a biological index of contamination: the Chloride Contamination Index (CCI). A power function yielded a significant correlation between this index and the mean Cl concentration measured at each spring. Taxa were able to be categorised as either 'tolerant' or 'non-tolerant' of high Cl although none was unique to either end of the scale. However, from both field observations and salinity tolerance trials in the laboratory, the amphipod Gammarus pseudolimnaeus was found to be associated with source aquifers only mildly contaminated with Cl. Absence of this species from a spring, particularly if nymphs of the stonefly Nemoura trispinosa are present should indicate moderate to high contamination.},

The greatest change in saltconcentration has occurred in the upper part of themonimolimnion (depth 10–15 m) where mean conductivityincreased 104.2 per cent, from 143 to 292 μS cm−1. Inthe upper mixolimnion (depth 0-5 m), mean conductivity rosefrom 130 to 238 μS cm−1 during the same period. Theions responsible for the salinity changes were Na+ andCl− from de-icing salts, and Ca2+ and Cl− fromsalts used to keep down dust from roads. Further sources ofCa2+ are the road asphalt and increased weathering andleaching of the lime-rich rocks caused by acid precipitation,the main source of the additional inputs of SO\$\$\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{4\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{2 - \}\}\} \$\$tothe lake. The salinity changes caused major changes inmeromictic stability, S\$\$S{\textbackslash}prime \_c \$\$.

Water column samples were collected approximately twice per month for fifteen months and analyzed for temperature, pH, conductivity, major ions, nutrients and redox-sensitive solutes. The lake water column was redox-stratified with high concentrations of dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), ammonium, phosphate and, during some periods, sulfide and methane in the hypolimnion. Bottom water anoxia was persistent throughout the entire sampling period. Concentrations of sodium and chloride, which correlated strongly with conductivity, were over a hundred times greater compared with levels in nearby rural lakes. Conductivity, chloride and calculated density profiles indicated the presence of a pycnocline at {\textasciitilde}9m depth that persisted throughout the sampling period. The chemical data demonstrate that road salt input has caused the lake to become meromictic, with a complete lack of fall and spring turnover.},

We studied Lake Tegel in Berlin, Germany as a representative urban lake profoundly influenced by intense water management measures and a resulting complex hydrodynamic situation: Lake Tegel is fed by nutrient-rich river discharges and effluents from a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP). We estimated changes in water temperatures, the Wedderburn number, and the buoyancy frequency, as well as concentrations of dissolved oxygen and phosphate under climate change using a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model coupled to a water quality model. Further, we investigated how four management scenarios with varying discharges of the PEP could affect the lake system. In all simulations, water temperatures increased and summer stratification extended. The modeling results demonstrated that the water management system buffers the high nutrient supply from the river inflow and can effectively mitigate negative effects of climate change on Lake Tegel, thus highlighting its importance for the lake ecosystem.},

	abstract = {A large number and wide variety of lake ecosystem models have been developed and published during the past four decades. We identify two challenges for making further progress in this field. One such challenge is to avoid developing more models largely following the concept of others (‘reinventing the wheel’). The other challenge is to avoid focusing on only one type of model, while ignoring new and diverse approaches that have become available (‘having tunnel vision’). In this paper, we aim at improving the awareness of existing models and knowledge of concurrent approaches in lake ecosystem modelling, without covering all possible model tools and avenues. First, we present a broad variety of modelling approaches. To illustrate these approaches, we give brief descriptions of rather arbitrarily selected sets of specific models. We deal with static models (steady state and regression models), complex dynamic models (CAEDYM, CE-QUAL-W2, Delft 3D-ECO, LakeMab, LakeWeb, MyLake, PCLake, PROTECH, SALMO), structurally dynamic models and minimal dynamic models. We also discuss a group of approaches that could all be classified as individual based: super-individual models (Piscator, Charisma), physiologically structured models, stage-structured models and trait-based models. We briefly mention genetic algorithms, neural networks, Kalman filters and fuzzy logic. Thereafter, we zoom in, as an in-depth example, on the multi-decadal development and application of the lake ecosystem model PCLake and related models (PCLake Metamodel, Lake Shira Model, IPH-TRIM3D-PCLake). In the discussion, we argue that while the historical development of each approach and model is understandable given its ‘leading principle’, there are many opportunities for combining approaches. We take the point of view that a single ‘right’ approach does not exist and should not be strived for. Instead, multiple modelling approaches, applied concurrently to a given problem, can help develop an integrative view on the functioning of lake ecosystems. We end with a set of specific recommendations that may be of help in the further development of lake ecosystem models.},

	abstract = {Fine-scale measurements and temperature gradient microstructure data are used to describe the diurnal energetics of the mixed layer in the Wellington Reservoir in Western Australia. The data covered a morning period of solar heating, a period of severe wind mixing induced by an afternoon sea breeze, and a period of pure penetrative convection extending through most of the night. The Wedderburn number (W) ranged from a value of 0.02 at the start of the heating phase to a value of about 10 at the end of the convective period. During the intermediate strong wind period the value of W remained about 0.1; the surface wind stress induced a strong tilt of the isotherms at the base of the mixed layer. The other main parameter, the ratio of the Monin-Obukhov length to the depth of the mixed layer, ranged from about 5.0 during the morning down to 0.005 at the end of the convective period. The full range of mixed-layer deepening processes could thus be analyzed. A simple one-dimensional integral mixed-layer model was applied to assess the importance of the temporal terms in diurnal simulations and to verify the values of the energy conversion efficiencies used in such models. Overall, the model performed extremely well; however, the results showed the need to develop parameterizations for the energetics of billowing induced by large shears across the base of the mixed layer and for the mixing accompanying upwelling.},

	abstract = {The numerical model presented here is based on the one-dimensional equations for momentum, heat, salt, and turbulent kinetic energy integrated over the diurnal mixed layer. Two noteworthy features are the inclusion of the energetics of billowing due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the base of the mixed layer, and a closure hypothesis which retains average mixed-layer turbulent kinetic energy as an explicit variable, rather than assuming it to be a fixed proportion of external energy input. The importance of both these features is illustrated in the application of the model to the data for 1 day which included several mixing processes: a fairly calm morning with uninterrupted solar heating, followed by rapid mixed-layer deepening during a strong afternoon sea breeze, and finally a relatively cool night with little wind. The data contain rapidly changing meteorological inputs as well as evidence of strong billow formation and collapse and thus provide an ideal test of the importance of both billow energetics and the temporal effects in the turbulent kinetic energy budget. The model does not account for processes occurring below the mixed layer nor for the effects of horizontal advection. Within these constraints, model results agree well with measured temperatures and represent an improvement over the results of a slab model without billow energetics.},

The numbers are based on basin geometry, density stratification, wind stress, and rates of inflow and outflow. The procedure highlights the differences in the dynamics of the two lakes and allows assessment of the validity of the assumption of one-dimensionality. The result is that both lakes were dominated by one-dimensional, but different processes. The dynamics of the epilimnion of the smaller lake were dominated by stirring from surface wind and cooling, whereas shear at the pycnocline was also significant in the larger lake. In neither case did the effects of the earth’s rotation, inflow, or outflow generate significant horizontal gradients. A one-dimensional numerical model (DYRESM) was used to simulate the vertical temperature and salinity structures of both lakes over lengthy periods, with good results. The model is based on the parameterization of the important physical processes in a framework of horizontal layers of variable thickness and was applied in both lakes without alteration. The interpretative power of the model is demonstrated by examination of the formation and erosion of a thermal inversion in the larger lake.},

	abstract = {The African great lakes are of utmost importance for the local economy (fishing), as well as being essential to the survival of the local people. During the past decades, these lakes experienced fast changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, and their future evolution is a major concern. In this study, for the first time a set of one-dimensional lake models are evaluated for Lake Kivu (2.28°S; 28.98°E), East Africa. The unique limnology of this meromictic lake, with the importance of salinity and subsurface springs in a tropical high-altitude climate, presents a worthy challenge to the seven models involved in the Lake Model Intercomparison Project (LakeMIP). Meteorological observations from two automatic weather stations are used to drive the models, whereas a unique dataset, containing over 150 temperature profiles recorded since 2002, is used to assess the model's performance. Simulations are performed over the freshwater layer only (60 m) and over the average lake depth (240 m), since salinity increases with depth below 60 m in Lake Kivu and some lake models do not account for the influence of salinity upon lake stratification. All models are able to reproduce the mixing seasonality in Lake Kivu, as well as the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the lake enthalpy change. Differences between the models can be ascribed to variations in the treatment of the radiative forcing and the computation of the turbulent heat fluxes. Fluctuations in wind velocity and solar radiation explain inter-annual variability of observed water column temperatures. The good agreement between the deep simulations and the observed meromictic stratification also shows that a subset of models is able to account for the salinity- and geothermal-induced effects upon deep-water stratification. Finally, based on the strengths and weaknesses discerned in this study, an informed choice of a one-dimensional lake model for a given research purpose becomes possible.},

	abstract = {Many studies of future climate change take an ensemble modeling approach in which simulations of future conditions are produced with multiple climate models (or model versions), rather than just one. These ensemble studies are of two main types—perturbed-physics and multimodel—which investigate different sources of uncertainty about future climate change. Increasingly, methods are being applied which assign probabilities to future changes in climate on the basis of the set of projections (the ensemble) produced in a perturbed-physics or multimodel study. This has prompted debate over both the appropriate interpretation of ensembles as well as how best to communicate uncertainty about future climate change to decision makers; such communication is a primary impetus for ensemble studies. The intuition persists that agreement among ensemble members about the extent of future climate change warrants increased confidence in the projected changes, but in practice the significance of this robustness is difficult to gauge. Priority topics for future research include how to design ensemble studies that take better account of structural uncertainty, how to weight ensemble members and how to improve the process by which ensemble studies are synthesized with other information in expert assessments.

The investigated lake was Großer Kossenblatter See (Germany) as a representative of shallow, (2 m mean depth) turbid midlatitude lakes. Meteorological measurements, including turbulent fluxes and water temperature, were carried out by the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory of the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). Eight lake models of different complexity were run, forced by identical meteorological variables and model parameters unified as far as possible given different formulations of processes. All models generally captured diurnal and seasonal variability of lake surface temperature reasonably well. However, some models were incapable of realistically reproducing temperature stratification in summer. Total heat turbulent fluxes, computed by the surface flux schemes of the compared lake models, deviated on average from those measured by eddy covariance by 17–28 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. There are a number of possible reasons for these deviations, and the conclusion is drawn that underestimation of real fluxes by the eddy covariance technique is the most probable reason. It is supported by the fact that the eddy covariance fluxes do not allow to close the heat balance of the water column, the residual for the whole period considered being \&asymp;\&\#8211;28 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. The effect of heat flux to bottom sediments can become significant for bottom temperatures. It also has profound influence on the surface temperatures in autumn due to convective mixing but not in summer when the lake stratification is stable. Thus, neglecting sediments shifts the summer–autumn temperature difference in models lacking explicit treatment of sediments considerably. As a practical recommendation based on results of the present study, we also infer that in order to realistically represent lakes in numerical weather prediction and climate models, it is advisable to use depth-resolving turbulence models (or equivalent) in favor of models with a completely mixed temperature profile.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Complex ecological models are used to predict the consequences of anticipated future changes in climate and nutrient loading for lake water quality. These models may, however, suffer from nonuniqueness in that various sets of model parameter values may yield equally satisfactory representations of the system being modeled, but when applied in future scenarios these sets of values may divert considerably in their simulated outcomes. Compilation of an ensemble of model runs allows us to account for simulation variability arising from model parameter estimates. Thus, we propose a new approach for aquatic ecological models creating a more robust prediction of future water quality. We used our ensemble approach in an application of the widely used PCLake model for Danish shallow Lake Arreskov, which during the past two decades has demonstrated frequent shifts between turbid and clear water states. Despite marked variability, the span of our ensemble runs encapsulated 70–90\% of the observed variation in lake water quality. The model exercise demonstrates that future warming and increased nutrient loading lead to lower probability of a clear water, vegetation-rich state and greater likelihood of cyanobacteria dominance. In a 6.0°C warming scenario, for instance, the current nutrient loading of nitrogen and phosphorus must be reduced by about 75\% to maintain the present ecological state of Lake Arreskov, but even in a near-future 2.0°C warming scenario, a higher probability of a turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated state is predicted. As managers may wish to determine the probability of achieving a certain ecological state, our proposed ensemble approach facilitates new ways of communicating future stressor impacts.},

The fact that estimates of the current state are inaccurate and that numerical models have inadequacies, leads to forecast errors that grow with increasing forecast lead time. The growth of errors depends on the flow itself. Ensemble forecasting aims at quantifying this flow-dependent forecast uncertainty. The sources of uncertainty in weather forecasting are discussed. Then, an overview is given on evaluating probabilistic forecasts and their usefulness compared with single forecasts. Thereafter, the representation of uncertainties in ensemble forecasts is reviewed with an emphasis on the initial condition perturbations. The review is complemented by a detailed description of the methodology to generate initial condition perturbations of the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). These perturbations are based on the leading part of the singular value decomposition of the operator describing the linearised dynamics over a finite time interval. The perturbations are flow-dependent as the linearisation is performed with respect to a solution of the nonlinear forecast model. The extent to which the current ECMWF ensemble prediction system is capable of predicting flow-dependent variations in uncertainty is assessed for the large-scale flow in mid-latitudes.},

	abstract = {Ensemble flood forecasting has gained significant momentum over the past decade due to the growth of ensemble numerical weather and climate prediction, expansion in high performance computing, growing interest in shifting from deterministic to risk-based decision-making that accounts for forecast uncertainty, and the efforts of communities such as the international Hydrologic Ensemble Prediction Experiment (HEPEX), which focuses on advancing relevant ensemble forecasting capabilities and fostering its adoption. With this shift, comes the need to understand the current state of ensemble flood forecasting, in order to provide insights into current capabilities and areas for improvement, thus identifying future research opportunities to allow for better allocation of research resources. In this article, we provide an overview of current research activities in ensemble flood forecasting and discuss knowledge gaps and future research opportunities, based on a review of 70 papers focusing on various aspects of ensemble flood forecasting around the globe. Future research directions include opportunities to improve technical aspects of ensemble flood forecasting, such as data assimilation techniques and methods to account for more sources of uncertainty, and developing ensemble forecasts for more variables, for example, flood inundation, by applying techniques such as machine learning. Further to this, we conclude that there is a need to not only improve technical aspects of flood forecasting, but also to bridge the gap between scientific research and hydrometeorological model development, and real-world flood management using probabilistic ensemble forecasts, especially through effective communication.

The uncertainty associated with these models is a major stumbling block in their acceptance as a management tool. Yet, conducting a rigorous uncertainty analysis of complex models is often not feasible. We present an alternative approach to assessing the impact of parameter uncertainty on the outcome of management scenarios on a lake ecosystem. We applied the single-model ensemble approach to the ecosystem model DYRESM–CAEDYM and Lake Kinneret, Israel. We introduced uncertainty to parameters and conducted an ensemble of simulations for three scenarios. Despite the large degree of uncertainty in parameter values the trends in ecosystem response were consistent with those observed based on calibrated parameter values. The variation in results allowed us to estimate the consequences of parameter uncertainty on lake resource management without the need for a comprehensive uncertainty analysis.},

We show that the average simulated phytoplankton biomass derived from three different aquatic ecosystem models is generally superior to any of the three individual models in describing observed phytoplankton biomass in a typical temperate lake ecosystem, and we simulate a series of climate change projections. While this is the first multi-model ensemble approach applied for some of the most complex aquatic ecosystem models available, we consider it sets a precedent for what will become commonplace methodology in the future, as it enables increased robustness of model projections, and scenario uncertainty estimation due to differences in model structures.},

	abstract = {Ensemble modelling was used to assess the robustness of projected impacts of pumped-storage (PS) operation and climate change on reservoir ice cover. To this end, three one-dimensional and a two-dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic model were set up. For the latter, the strength of the impacts with increasing distance from the dam was also investigated. Climate change effects were simulated by forcing the models with 150 years of synthetic meteorological time series created with a weather generator based on available air temperature scenarios for Switzerland. Future climate by the end of the 21st century was projected to shorten the ice-covered period by 2 months and decrease ice thicknesses by 13 cm. Under current climate conditions, the ice cover would already be affected by extended PS operation. For example, the average probability of ice coverage on a specific day was projected to decrease by 13\% for current climate and could further be reduced from 45\% to 10\% for future climate. Overall, the results of all models were consistent. Although the number of winters without ice cover was projected to increase for all one-dimensional models, studying individual segments of the two-dimensional model showed that the impact was pronounced for segments close to the PS intake/outlet. In summary, the reservoir's ice cover is expected to partially vanish with higher probability of open water conditions closer to the PS intake/outlet.},

	abstract = {The physical dynamics of lake temperature and ice phenology are important in the modelling and management of temperate aquatic ecosystems. One-dimensional hydrothermal lake models have not been well evaluated in terms of how they simulate ice dynamics in particular. We chose four models (Hostetler, Minlake, Simple Ice Model or SIM and General Lake Model) to test and compare their performance modelling water temperature and ice dynamics using 16 years of field data from Harp Lake, an extensively studied inland lake in south-central Ontario. Each model produced satisfactory water temperature profiles over the simulated period, with small differences in the model performance. Model fits for ice phenology and ice thickness were, however, considerably lower than those for water temperature, with Minlake generating the best agreement with observed ice-on and ice-off dates as well as ice thickness, followed by SIM. The responses of lake ice dynamics to future climate scenarios were simulated by running each of the four models for 91 years, from 2010 to 2100. The predicted decrease in ice season length was significantly different among models, varying between 30 and 81 days, with an average of 48 days. Corresponding decreases in ice thickness varied between 0.11 and 0.20 m, averaging 0.17 m. This study demonstrates that uncertainty due to model performance and selection is considerable, and further testing and refinement of hydrothermal lake dynamic models are needed to improve predictive abilities for ice dynamics.

	abstract = {Abstract. In Paris, France, December 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide a "special report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways". In Nairobi, Kenya, April 2016, the IPCC panel accepted the invitation. Here we describe the response devised within the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) to provide tailored, cross-sectorally consistent impacts projections. The simulation protocol is designed to allow for (1) separation of the impacts of historical warming starting from pre-industrial conditions from other human drivers such as historical land-use changes (based on pre-industrial and historical impact model simulations); (2) quantification of the effects of additional warming up to 1.5 °C, including a potential overshoot and long-term effects up to 2299, compared to a no-mitigation scenario (based on the low-emissions Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6 and a no-mitigation pathway RCP6.0) with socio-economic conditions fixed at 2005 levels; and (3) assessment of the climate effects based on the same climate scenarios but accounting for simultaneous changes in socio-economic conditions following the middle-of-the-road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2, Fricko et al., 2016) and differential bio-energy requirements associated with the transformation of the energy system to comply with RCP2.6 compared to RCP6.0. With the aim of providing the scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across sectors and analysis of cross-sectoral interactions that may dampen or amplify sectoral impacts, the protocol is designed to facilitate consistent impacts projections from a range of impact models across different sectors (global and regional hydrology, global crops, global vegetation, regional forests, global and regional marine ecosystems and fisheries, global and regional coastal infrastructure, energy supply and demand, health, and tropical cyclones).},

Output from weather generators, on the other hand, can simulate short-term extreme conditions and weather patterns. In order to evaluate the likely impact of climate changes on a large sub-tropical lake, specifically the thermal regime of the lake, we constructed climate scenarios using a weather generator. The 30-year scenarios included no change in climate conditions, a gradual change, increased frequency of heat waves and a merging of the latter two. The projected impact on the lake\&rsquo;s physical properties was evaluated using an ensemble of 1-D hydrodynamic lake models. The gradual increase scenario had the largest impact on annual temperatures and stratification period; however, increased heat waves had a large effect on the summer lake conditions and introduced a larger degree of variability in water temperature. The use of the ensemble of models resulted in variability in the projected impacts; yet, the large degree of similarity between projected trends and patterns increased confidence in the results. The projected effect the heat waves will have on the lake conditions highlights the need to include heat waves in climate studies and the need for impact studies in order to better understand possible consequences for lake ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) was used to dynamically downscale two Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM) simulations of the transient climate change for the period 1950–2100, over North America, following the CORDEX protocol. The CRCM5 was driven by data from the CanESM2 and MPI-ESM-LR CGCM simulations, based on the historical (1850–2005) and future (2006–2100) RCP4.5 radiative forcing scenario. The results show that the CRCM5 simulations reproduce relatively well the current-climate North American regional climatic features, such as the temperature and precipitation multiannual means, annual cycles and temporal variability at daily scale. A cold bias was noted during the winter season over western and southern portions of the continent. CRCM5-simulated precipitation accumulations at daily temporal scale are much more realistic when compared with its driving CGCM simulations, especially in summer when small-scale driven convective precipitation has a large contribution over land. The CRCM5 climate projections imply a general warming over the continent in the 21st century, especially over the northern regions in winter. The winter warming is mostly contributed by the lower percentiles of daily temperatures, implying a reduction in the frequency and intensity of cold waves. A precipitation decrease is projected over Central America and an increase over the rest of the continent. For the average precipitation change in summer however there is little consensus between the simulations. Some of these differences can be attributed to the uncertainties in CGCM-projected changes in the position and strength of the Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure.},

These models may, however, suffer from nonuniqueness in that various sets of model parameter values may yield equally satisfactory representations of the system being modeled, but when applied in future scenarios these sets of values may divert considerably in their simulated outcomes. Compilation of an ensemble of model runs allows us to account for simulation variability arising from model parameter estimates. Thus, we propose a new approach for aquatic ecological models creating a more robust prediction of future water quality. We used our ensemble approach in an application of the widely used PCLake model for Danish shallow Lake Arreskov, which during the past two decades has demonstrated frequent shifts between turbid and clear water states. Despite marked variability, the span of our ensemble runs encapsulated 70–90\% of the observed variation in lake water quality. The model exercise demonstrates that future warming and increased nutrient loading lead to lower probability of a clear water, vegetation-rich state and greater likelihood of cyanobacteria dominance. In a 6.0°C warming scenario, for instance, the current nutrient loading of nitrogen and phosphorus must be reduced by about 75\% to maintain the present ecological state of Lake Arreskov, but even in a near-future 2.0°C warming scenario, a higher probability of a turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated state is predicted. As managers may wish to determine the probability of achieving a certain ecological state, our proposed ensemble approach facilitates new ways of communicating future stressor impacts.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The ability of the one-dimensional lake model FLake to represent the mixolimnion temperatures for tropical conditions was tested for three locations in East Africa: Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika's northern and southern basins. Meteorological observations from surrounding automatic weather stations were corrected and used to drive FLake, whereas a comprehensive set of water temperature profiles served to evaluate the model at each site. Careful forcing data correction and model configuration made it possible to reproduce the observed mixed layer seasonality at Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika (northern and southern basins), with correct representation of both the mixed layer depth and water temperatures. At Lake Kivu, mixolimnion temperatures predicted by FLake were found to be sensitive both to minimal variations in the external parameters and to small changes in the meteorological driving data, in particular wind velocity. In each case, small modifications may lead to a regime switch, from the correctly represented seasonal mixed layer deepening to either completely mixed or permanently stratified conditions from {\textasciitilde} 10 m downwards. In contrast, model temperatures were found to be robust close to the surface, with acceptable predictions of near-surface water temperatures even when the seasonal mixing regime is not reproduced. FLake can thus be a suitable tool to parameterise tropical lake water surface temperatures within atmospheric prediction models. Finally, FLake was used to attribute the seasonal mixing cycle at Lake Kivu to variations in the near-surface meteorological conditions. It was found that the annual mixing down to 60 m during the main dry season is primarily due to enhanced lake evaporation and secondarily to the decreased incoming long wave radiation, both causing a significant heat loss from the lake surface and associated mixolimnion cooling.},

	abstract = {The impact of air temperature rise is eminent for the large deep lakes in the Italian subalpine district, climate change being caused there by both natural phenomena and anthropogenic greenhouse-gases (GHG) emissions. These oligomictic lakes are experiencing a decrease in the frequency of winter full turnover and an intensification of stability. As a result, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations are decreasing and nutrients are accumulating in bottom water, with effects on the whole ecosystem functioning. Forecasting the future evolution of the mixing pattern is relevant to assess if a reduction in GHG releases would be able to revert such processes. The study focuses on Lake Maggiore, for which the thermal structure evolution under climate change in the 2016–2085 period was assessed through numerical simulations, performed with the General Lake Model (GLM). Different prospects of regional air temperature rise were considered, given by the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario to obtain robust statistical predictions, adopting random series of meteorological data produced with the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG). Results show that a reversion in the increasing thermal stability would be possible only if global GHG emissions started to be reduced by {\textasciitilde} 2020, allowing an equilibrium mixing regime to be restored by the end of the twenty-first century. Otherwise, persistent lack of complete-mixing, severe water warming and extensive effects on water quality are to be expected for the centuries to come. These projections can be extended to the other lakes in the subalpine district.},

	abstract = {Thermal dynamics of lakes has a key role in chemical and biological processes in lakes including nutrient distributions and phytoplankton growth. Applications of hydrodynamic models to lakes can provide insights into possible future alterations in thermal dynamics induced by climate change. In this study, we present the calibration and validation of the newest version of the open-source hydrodynamic model GLM (General Lake Model) to the dimictic Lake Ammersee, located in south-east Germany. The simulation of lake water temperatures for the calibration period revealed an overall root mean square error of 0.65 °C and a mean error of 0.08 °C. The seasonal stratification pattern and the annual thermal structure of this dimictic lake were reproduced by the model. The model simulated the presence of winter ice cover for the only year out of 8 years simulated, when ice cover was observed. Elevated lake water temperatures were also reproduced in model simulations during a period in 2003 of unusually high air temperatures. Statistical analysis of the model calibration results for Lake Ammersee indicates a fit comparable to or better than most other well-established hydrodynamic models and provides an opportunity for continuous simulations through periods of ice cover. Our results indicate a major improvement in GLM compared with earlier model versions and demonstrate the applicability of GLM for limnophysical studies, particularly for altered forcing conditions such as climate change.},

	abstract = {Sustainable management of drinking water reservoirs requires balancing the demands of water supply whilst minimizing environmental impact. This study numerically simulates the effect of an improved withdrawal scheme designed to alleviate the temperature pollution downstream of a reservoir. The aim was to identify an optimal withdrawal strategy such that water of a desirable discharge temperature can be supplied downstream without leading to unacceptably low oxygen concentrations within the reservoir. First, we calibrated a one-dimensional numerical model for hydrodynamics and oxygen dynamics (GLM-AED2), verifying that the model reproduced water temperatures and hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations accurately over a 5 year period. Second, the model was extended to include an adaptive withdrawal functionality, allowing for a prescribed withdrawal temperature to be found, with the potential constraint of hypolimnetic oxygen concentration. Scenario simulations on epi-/metalimnetic withdrawal demonstrate that the model is able to autonomously determine the best withdrawal height depending on the thermal structure and the hypolimnetic oxygen concentration thereby optimizing the ability to supply a desirable discharge temperature to the downstream river during summer. This new withdrawal strategy also increased the hypolimnetic raw water volume to be used for drinking water supply, but reduced the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the deep and cold water layers (hypolimnion). Implications of the results for reservoir management are discussed and the numerical model is provided for operators as a simple and efficient tool for optimizing the withdrawal strategy within different reservoir contexts.},

In this study, a well-established one-dimensional hydrodynamic model (GLM) was used to investigate the response of stratification dynamics in Rappbode Reservoir to different wind conditions, in particular to episodic strong wind events. In years with increased wind speed, stratification duration and intensity were reduced. Episodic wind forcing by strong wind events are important determinants of thermal structure and can induce persisting shifts in the thermal structure that remain over the season until the next overturn. The results showed that reductions in stratification intensity were particularly distinct when the strong wind occurred in early summer. Strong wind events outside of this sensitive time window did not exert an important impact on the thermal dynamics of the reservoir. Our research confirms the decisive impact of wind speed on stratification of lakes and reservoirs. It effectively illustrates the sensitive time window of thermal dynamics to episodic wind events.},

Here we use a lake model to assess the influence of atmospheric stilling, on lake thermal dynamics across the Northern Hemisphere. From 1980 to 2016, lake thermal responses to warming have accelerated as a result of atmospheric stilling. Lake surface temperatures and thermal stability have changed at respective rates of 0.33 and 0.38 °C/decade, with atmospheric stilling contributing 15\% and 27\% of the calculated changes, respectively. Atmospheric stilling also resulted in a lengthening of stratification, contributing 23\% of the calculated changes.

	abstract = {Changes in meteorological patterns to drier conditions alter the hydrodynamic processes of reservoirs and can affect their thermal structure. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of a severe drought period on the hydrodynamics of a tropical reservoir. One-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling was applied from 2009 to 2016 to simulate the thermal dynamics of the highly drought-impacted Serra Azul reservoir, a drinking water supply reservoir located in southeast Brazil. After calibration (r = 0.91, root mean square error [RMSE] = 1.33 °C) and validation of the model (r = 0.87, RMSE = 2.06 °C), physical indicators were calculated to evaluate the stratification and mixing processes in the water column. Results showed that the reservoir hydrodynamics were affected by the drought period through an increase in mixing frequency and duration. Negative implications for water quality are expected, such as higher concentration of dissolved substances and nutrients and increased turbidity, salinity, and electrical conductivity, as observed in most lakes and reservoirs subjected to drought. Different water withdrawal scenarios were simulated, and a critical water withdrawal volume that could prevent drought impacts on the Serra Azul reservoir thermal regime was identified. This study indicates the need for managers to understand potential impacts of extreme meteorological events in reservoir dynamics, particularly when the reservoirs are part of drinking water systems.},

The physical model component allows for a number of different statistical turbulence closure schemes, ranging from simple algebraic closures to two-equation turbulence models with algebraic second-moment closures. The biogeochemical module consists of models which are based on a number of state variables represented by their ensemble averaged concentrations. Specific biogeochemical models may range from simple NPZ (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton) to complex ecosystem models. Recently developed modified Patankar solvers for ordinary differential equations allow for stable discretisations of the production and destruction terms guaranteeing conservative and non-negative solutions. The increased stability of these new solvers over explicit solvers is demonstrated for a plankton spring bloom simulation. The model system is applied to marine ecosystem dynamics the Northern North Sea and the Central Gotland Sea. Two different biogeochemical models are applied, a conservative nitrogen-based model to the North Sea, and a more complex model including an oxygen equation to the Baltic Sea, allowing for the reproduction of chemical processes under anoxic conditions. For both applications, earlier model results obtained with slightly different model setups could be basically reproduced. It became however clear that the choice for ecosystem model parameters such as maximum phytoplankton growth rates does strongly depend on the physical model parameters (such as turbulence closure models or external forcing).},

The General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) one-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate water temperature when using ISIMIP2b bias-corrected climate model projections as input. These projections have a daily time step, while lake model simulations are often forced at hourly or shorter time steps. Therefore, it was necessary to first test the ability of GOTM to simulate Lake Erken water temperature using daily vs hourly meteorological forcing data. In order to do this, three data sets were used to force the model as follows: (1) hourly measured data, (2) daily average data derived from the first data set, and (3) synthetic hourly data created from the daily data set using generalised regression artificial neural network methods. This last data set is developed using a method that could also be applied to the daily time step ISIMIP scenarios to obtain hourly model input if needed. The lake model was shown to accurately simulate Lake Erken water temperature when forced with either daily or synthetic hourly data. Long-term simulations forced with daily or synthetic hourly meteorological data suggest that by the late 21st century the lake will undergo clear changes in thermal structure. For the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario, namely RCP2.6, surface water temperature was projected to increase by 1.79 and 1.36\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C when the lake model was forced at daily and hourly resolutions respectively, and for RCP6.0 these increases were projected to be 3.08 and 2.31\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C. Changes in lake stability were projected to increase, and the stratification duration was projected to be longer by 13 and 11\&thinsp;d under RCP2.6 scenario and 22 and 18\&thinsp;d under RCP6.0 scenario for daily and hourly resolutions. Model changes in thermal indices were very similar when using either the daily or synthetic hourly forcing, suggesting that the original ISIMIP climate model projections at a daily time step can be sufficient for the purpose of simulating lake water temperature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis provide powerful means to enhance the performance of the models, to increase the transparency and credibility of the model results, and to allow the decision-maker to judge whether the model results are sufficiently accurate and precise to support decision-making or not. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of numerical models usually require hundreds, thousands, or even more, repeated model runs (e.g., in Monte Carlo simulation) as well as access to change the model parameters and variables on each model run. Consequently, many model codes, although widely used and well-formulated, are not well-suited for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis due to too long model execution time or due to lack of suitable interface to change model parameters and variables in an automated way. In this paper, we describe in details a lake model code, which aims to combine good simulation capabilities with efficient model execution time and easy application of numerical uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques. This model code is called MyLake (Multi-year Lake simulation model) and it is a one-dimensional process-based model code for simulation of daily vertical distribution of lake water temperature and thus density stratification, evolution of seasonal lake ice and snow cover, sediment–water interactions, and phosphorus-phytoplankton dynamics. After giving a detailed technical description of the different processes and algorithms included in the current version 1.2 of the MyLake model code, we present some results from a model application example including an Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (Extended FAST) sensitivity analysis and a simple Monte Carlo simulation based uncertainty analysis. Finally we discuss the performance of the MyLake code, especially in connection with numerical uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques.},

	abstract = {Rogoznica Lake is highly eutrophic marine system located on the Eastern Adriatic coast (43°32′N, 15°58′E). Because of the relatively small size (10,276m2) and depth (15m) it experiences strong natural and indirect anthropogenic influences. Dynamics within the lake is characterized by the extreme and highly variable environmental conditions (seasonal variations in salinity and temperature, water stratification and mixing, redox and euxinic conditions, concentrations of nutrients) which significantly influence the biology inside the lake. Due to the high phytoplankton activity, the upper part of the water column is well oxygenated, while hypoxia/anoxia usually occurs in the bottom layers. Anoxic part of the water column is characterized with high concentrations of sulfide (up to 5mM) and nutrients (NH4+ up to 315μM; PO43− up to 53μM; SiO44− up to 680μM) indicating the pronounced remineralization of the allochthonous organic matter, produced in the surface waters. The mixolimnion varies significantly within a season feeling effects of the Adriatic atmospheric and ocean dynamics (temperature, wind, heat fluxes, rainfall) which all affect the vertical stability and possibly induce vertical mixing and/or turnover. Seasonal vertical mixing usually occurs during the autumn/winter upon the breakdown of the stratification, injecting oxygen-rich water from the surface into the deeper layers. Depending on the intensity and duration of the vertical dynamics (slower diffusion and/or faster turnover of the water layers) anoxic conditions could developed within the whole water column. Extreme weather events such as abrupt change in the air temperature accompanied with a strong wind and consequently heat flux are found to be a key triggering mechanism for the fast turnover, introducing a large amount of nutrients and sulfur species from deeper parts to the surface. Increased concentration of nutrients, especially ammonium, phosphate, and silicates persisting for several months after the mixing event, together with anoxic stress conditions, additionally influence already stressed ecosystem, hence shifting the community structure and food/web interactions in this marine system.},

However, in most cases such records span a short period of time and/or are incomplete, providing a less credible assessment of change. In this study, the hydrodynamic GOTM (General Ocean Turbulence Model, a hydrodynamic model configured in lake mode) was used to reconstruct daily profiles of water temperature in Lake Erken (Sweden) over the period 1961–2017 using seven climatic parameters as forcing data: wind speed (WS), air temperature (Air {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{T}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}), atmospheric pressure (Air {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{P}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}), relative humidity (RH), cloud cover (CC), precipitation (DP), and shortwave radiation (SWR). The model was calibrated against observed water temperature data collected during the study interval, and the calibrated model revealed a good match between modelled and observed temperature (RMSE\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}=1.089{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C). From the long-term simulations of water temperature, this study focused on detecting possible trends in water temperature over the entire study interval 1961–2017 and in the sub-intervals 1961–1988 and 1989–2017, since an abrupt change in air temperature was detected in 1988. The analysis of the simulated temperature showed that epilimnetic temperature increased on average by 0.444 and 0.792\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C per decade in spring and autumn in the sub-interval 1989–2017. Summer epilimnetic temperature increased by 0.351\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C per decade over the entire interval 1961–2017.

Whole-lake temperature showed a significant increasing trend in the sub-interval 1989–2017 during spring (0.404\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C per decade) and autumn (0.789\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C per decade, interval 1989–2016), while a significant trend was detected in summer over the entire study interval 1961–2017 (0.239\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C per decade). Moreover, this study showed that changes in the phenology of thermal stratification have occurred over the 57-year period of study. Since 1961, the stability of stratification (Schmidt stability) has increased by 5.365\&thinsp;J\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} per decade. The duration of thermal stratification has increased by 7.297\&thinsp;d per decade, corresponding to an earlier onset of stratification of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼16{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;d and to a delay of stratification termination of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼26{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;d. The average thermocline depth during stratification became shallower by {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼1.345{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m, and surface-bottom temperature difference increased over time by 0.249\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C per decade. The creation of a daily time step water temperature dataset not only provided evidence of changes in Erken thermal structure over the last decades, but is also a valuable resource of information that can help in future research on the ecology of Lake Erken. The use of readily available meteorological data to reconstruct Lake Erken's past water temperature is shown to be a useful method to evaluate long-term changes in lake thermal structure, and it is a method that can be extended to other lakes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

They offer the possibility to analyze processes at high frequency, here referring to hourly timescales, to investigate scenarios and test hypotheses. Yet, simulation outputs are mainly used by the modellers themselves and often not easily reachable for the outside community. We have developed an open-access web-based platform for visualization and promotion of easy access to lake model output data updated in near-real time ({\textless}span class="uri"{\textgreater}http://simstrat.eawag.ch{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, last access: 29 August 2019). This platform was developed for 54 lakes in Switzerland with potential for adaptation to other regions or at global scale using appropriate forcing input data. The benefit of this data platform is practically illustrated with two examples. First, we show that the output data allows for assessing the long-term effects of past climate change on the thermal structure of a lake. The study confirms the need to not only evaluate changes in all atmospheric forcing but also changes in the watershed or throughflow heat energy and changes in light penetration to assess the lake thermal structure. Then, we show how the data platform can be used to study and compare the role of episodic strong wind events for different lakes on a regional scale and especially how their thermal structure is temporarily destabilized. With this open-access data platform, we demonstrate a new path forward for scientists and practitioners promoting a cross exchange of expertise through openly sharing in situ and model data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The investigated lake was Großer Kossenblatter See (Germany) as a representative of shallow, (2 m mean depth) turbid midlatitude lakes. Meteorological measurements, including turbulent fluxes and water temperature, were carried out by the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory of the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). Eight lake models of different complexity were run, forced by identical meteorological variables and model parameters unified as far as possible given different formulations of processes. All models generally captured diurnal and seasonal variability of lake surface temperature reasonably well. However, some models were incapable of realistically reproducing temperature stratification in summer. Total heat turbulent fluxes, computed by the surface flux schemes of the compared lake models, deviated on average from those measured by eddy covariance by 17–28 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. There are a number of possible reasons for these deviations, and the conclusion is drawn that underestimation of real fluxes by the eddy covariance technique is the most probable reason. It is supported by the fact that the eddy covariance fluxes do not allow to close the heat balance of the water column, the residual for the whole period considered being \&asymp;\&\#8211;28 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$. The effect of heat flux to bottom sediments can become significant for bottom temperatures. It also has profound influence on the surface temperatures in autumn due to convective mixing but not in summer when the lake stratification is stable. Thus, neglecting sediments shifts the summer–autumn temperature difference in models lacking explicit treatment of sediments considerably. As a practical recommendation based on results of the present study, we also infer that in order to realistically represent lakes in numerical weather prediction and climate models, it is advisable to use depth-resolving turbulence models (or equivalent) in favor of models with a completely mixed temperature profile.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In addition to high nutrient loads, climate-induced changes in lake stratification and mixing represent additional anthropogenic menace resulting in decreased deepwater oxygen levels. The analysis of 43 years of monitoring data from Lake Geneva shows no decreasing trend neither in the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate nor in the extent of hypoxia. Instead, hypoxic conditions are predominantly controlled by deep mixing in winter and much less by the trophic variations over the past decades. To reproduce winter mixing, the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model SIMSTRAT was specially adapted to deep lakes and run for several climate scenarios. The simulations predicted a decrease in the maximum winter mixing depth from an average of ∼172 m for 1981–2012 to ∼136 m and ∼127 m in response to predicted atmospheric temperatures between 2045–2076 and 2070–2101 according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios. Concurrently, events with complete homogenization of temperature and oxygen in winter will decrease by ∼50\%. Consequently, the hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations will significantly decrease. These results demonstrate that changes in deep mixing can have stronger impact than eutrophication on the deepwater oxygen levels of oligomictic lakes.},

LakeMetabolizer implements 5 different metabolism models with diverse statistical underpinnings: bookkeeping, ordinary least squares, maximum likelihood, Kalman filter, and Bayesian. Each of these 5 metabolism models can be combined with 1 of 7 models for computing the coefficient of gas exchange across the air–water interface (k). LakeMetabolizer also features a variety of supporting functions that compute conversions and implement calculations commonly applied to raw data prior to estimating metabolism (e.g., oxygen saturation and optical conversion models). These tools have been organized into an R package that contains example data, example use-cases, and function documentation. The release package version is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and the full open-source GPL-licensed code is freely available for examination and extension online.

	abstract = {Background: Environmental health research employs a variety of metrics to measure heat exposure, both to directly study the health effects of outdoor temperature and to control for temperature in studies of other environmental exposures, including air pollution. To measure heat exposure, environmental health studies often use heat index, which incorporates both air temperature and moisture. However, the method of calculating heat index varies across environmental studies, which could mean that studies using different algorithms to calculate heat index may not be comparable.Objective and Methods: We investigated 21 separate heat index algorithms found in the literature to determine a) whether different algorithms generate heat index values that are consistent with the theoretical concepts of apparent temperature and b) whether different algorithms generate similar heat index values.Results: Although environmental studies differ in how they calculate heat index values, most studies’ heat index algorithms generate values consistent with apparent temperature. Additionally, most different algorithms generate closely correlated heat index values. However, a few algorithms are potentially problematic, especially in certain weather conditions (e.g., very low relative humidity, cold weather). To aid environmental health researchers, we have created open-source software in R to calculate the heat index using the U.S. National Weather Service’s algorithm.Conclusion: We identified 21 separate heat index algorithms used in environmental research. Our analysis demonstrated that methods to calculate heat index are inconsistent across studies. Careful choice of a heat index algorithm can help ensure reproducible and consistent environmental health research.Citation: Anderson GB, Bell ML, Peng RD. 2013.

The model was parametrized against year-round time series of water temperature and DO from a lake buoy. Observed trends in air temperature (+0.045°C yr−1) and DOC concentration (0.11 mg C L−1 yr−1, +1\% annually) over the past 40 years were used as model forcings. A backcast of ice freezing and breakup dates revealed that ice breakup occurred on average 8 days earlier in 2014 than in 1974. The earlier ice breakup enhanced water column ventilation resulting in higher DO in the spring. Warmer water in late summer led to longer anoxic periods, as microbial DOC turnover increased. A long-term increase in DOC concentrations caused a decline in lake DO, leading to 15\% more hypoxic days ({\textless}3 mg L−1) and 10\% more anoxic days ({\textless}15 µg L−1) in 2014 than in 1974. We conclude that climate warming and increasing DOC loads are antagonistic with respect to their effect on DO availability. The model suggests that DOC is a stronger driver of DO consumption than temperature. The browning of lakes may thus cause reductions in the oxythermal habitat of fish and aquatic biota in boreal lakes.},

2002), to assess their ability to predict spatial and temporal patterns in the physical, chemical and biological dynamics of planktonic systems. The selected modeling studies covered a wide range of model complexity, ecosystem-types, spatio-temporal
scales and purposes for model development. Despite the heterogeneous nature of this data set, we were able to identify model behavior trends and illuminate aspects of current modeling practice that need to be reevaluated. Temperature and dissolved oxygen
had the highest coefficients of determination (respective median r2 values were 0.93 and 0.70) and the lowest relative error (median RE {\textless} 10\%), nutrients and phytoplankton had intermediate predictability (median r2 values
ranging from 0.40 to 0.60 and median RE {\textasciitilde} 40\%), whereas bacteria (median r2 = 0.06) and zooplankton (median RE = 70\%) dynamics were poorly predicted. Longer simulation periods (i.e. months to decades) reduced model predictability, and increased
model complexity did not improve fit. Aquatic biogeochemical modelers need to be more consistent in how they apply conventional methodological steps during model development (i.e. sensitivity analysis, validation), and the aquatic modeling community
should adopt generally accepted standards of model performance. Recent advancements in data assimilation techniques, the combination of the present family of models with goal functions (derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the development of
models with a stronger physiological basis are promising frameworks for obtaining more accurate simulations of planktonic processes.},

Although a large number of lakes across the globe are systematically monitored, it is rare to have a wide range of ecological indices measured at high enough frequency and over a sufficient time scale to allow characterisation of the response of a lake ecosystem to such events. We present data from Lough Feeagh, a relatively large oligotrophic lake in Ireland, which was at the epicentre of a once in 250-year precipitation event in July 2009 when 50 mm of rain fell in less than 2 hours. The effects of the resulting flood on the water column stability, chemistry, biology, and metabolism were examined, and data from multiple years before and after the event were used to ascertain the significance and longevity of any observed changes. The flood caused the water column to destabilise prematurely and depressed primary production. Bacterial biomass was high in the month after the flood, and zooplankton assemblages in late 2009 were significantly different from those of other years. Changes in all these variables combined to produce lower rates of gross primary production and higher rates of respiration than those measured between 2010 and 2014, resulting in more pronounced negative net ecosystem production than in the other years. Despite all these changes, the normal seasonal cycles resumed in 2010, and it appears that this rare but significant event did not have a long-term impact on the ecosystem functioning of the lake.},

	abstract = {We examined the factors that determine the citations of 153 mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical modeling papers published from 1990 to 2002. Our analysis provides overwhelming evidence that ocean modeling is a dynamic area of the current modeling practice. Models developed to gain insight into the ocean carbon cycle/marine biogeochemistry are most highly cited, the produced knowledge is exported to other cognitive disciplines, and oceanic modelers are less reluctant to embrace technical advances (e.g., assimilation schemes) and more critically increase model complexity. Contrary to our predictions, model application for environmental management issues on a local scale seems to have languished; the pertinent papers comprise a smaller portion of the published modeling literature and receive lower citations. Given the critical planning information that these models aim to provide, we hypothesize that the latter finding probably stems from conceptual weaknesses, methodological omissions, and an evident lack of haste from modelers to adopt new ideas in their repertoire when addressing environmental management issues. We also highlight the lack of significant association between citation frequency and model complexity, model performance, implementation of conventional methodological steps during model development (e.g., validation, sensitivity analysis), number of authors, and country of affiliation. While these results cast doubt on the rationale of the current modeling practice, the fact that the Fasham et al. (1990) paper has received over 400 citations probably dictates what should be done from the modeling community to meet the practical need for attractive and powerful modeling tools.},

	abstract = {The fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) was used to dynamically downscale two Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM) simulations of the transient climate change for the period 1950–2100, over North America, following the CORDEX protocol. The CRCM5 was driven by data from the CanESM2 and MPI-ESM-LR CGCM simulations, based on the historical (1850–2005) and future (2006–2100) RCP4.5 radiative forcing scenario. The results show that the CRCM5 simulations reproduce relatively well the current-climate North American regional climatic features, such as the temperature and precipitation multiannual means, annual cycles and temporal variability at daily scale. A cold bias was noted during the winter season over western and southern portions of the continent. CRCM5-simulated precipitation accumulations at daily temporal scale are much more realistic when compared with its driving CGCM simulations, especially in summer when small-scale driven convective precipitation has a large contribution over land. The CRCM5 climate projections imply a general warming over the continent in the 21st century, especially over the northern regions in winter. The winter warming is mostly contributed by the lower percentiles of daily temperatures, implying a reduction in the frequency and intensity of cold waves. A precipitation decrease is projected over Central America and an increase over the rest of the continent. For the average precipitation change in summer however there is little consensus between the simulations. Some of these differences can be attributed to the uncertainties in CGCM-projected changes in the position and strength of the Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure.},

	abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are experiencing greater variability due to human activities, necessitating new tools to anticipate future water quality. In response, we developed and deployed a real-time iterative water temperature forecasting system (FLARE—Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems). FLARE is composed of water temperature and meteorology sensors that wirelessly stream data, a data assimilation algorithm that uses sensor observations to update predictions from a hydrodynamic model and calibrate model parameters, and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to generate forecasts that include uncertainty. Importantly, FLARE quantifies the contribution of different sources of uncertainty (driver data, initial conditions, model process, and parameters) to each daily forecast of water temperature at multiple depths. We applied FLARE to Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), a drinking water supply, during a 475-day period encompassing stratified and mixed thermal conditions. Aggregated across this period, root mean square error (RMSE) of daily forecasted water temperatures was 1.13°C at the reservoir's near-surface (1.0 m) for 7-day ahead forecasts and 1.62°C for 16-day ahead forecasts. The RMSE of forecasted water temperatures at the near-sediments (8.0 m) was 0.87°C for 7-day forecasts and 1.20°C for 16-day forecasts. FLARE successfully predicted the onset of fall turnover 4–14 days in advance in two sequential years. Uncertainty partitioning identified meteorology driver data as the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts for most depths and thermal conditions, except for the near-sediments in summer, when model process uncertainty dominated. Overall, FLARE provides an open-source system for lake and reservoir water quality forecasting to improve real-time management.},

Despite the importance of this heat budget, heat uptake by inland waters has so far not been quantified. Here we use a unique combination of global-scale lake models, global hydrological models and Earth system models to quantify global heat uptake by natural lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. The total net heat uptake by inland waters amounts to 2.6 ± 3.2 ×1020 J over the period 1900–2020, corresponding to 3.6\% of the energy stored on land. The overall uptake is dominated by natural lakes (111.7\%), followed by reservoir warming (2.3\%). Rivers contribute negatively (-14\%) due to a decreasing water volume. The thermal energy of water stored in artificial reservoirs exceeds inland water heat uptake by a factor ∼10.4. This first quantification underlines that the heat uptake by inland waters is relatively small, but non-negligible.},

In Nairobi, Kenya, April 2016, the IPCC panel accepted the invitation. Here we describe the response devised within the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) to provide tailored, cross-sectorally consistent impact projections to broaden the scientific basis for the report. The simulation protocol is designed to allow for (1) separation of the impacts of historical warming starting from pre-industrial conditions from impacts of other drivers such as historical land-use changes (based on pre-industrial and historical impact model simulations); (2) quantification of the impacts of additional warming up to 1.5 °C, including a potential overshoot and long-term impacts up to 2299, and comparison to higher levels of global mean temperature change (based on the low-emissions Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6 and a no-mitigation pathway RCP6.0) with socio-economic conditions fixed at 2005 levels; and (3) assessment of the climate effects based on the same climate scenarios while accounting for simultaneous changes in socio-economic conditions following the middle-of-the-road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2, Fricko et al., 2016) and in particular differential bioenergy requirements associated with the transformation of the energy system to comply with RCP2.6 compared to RCP6.0. With the aim of providing the scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across sectors and analysis of cross-sectoral interactions that may dampen or amplify sectoral impacts, the protocol is designed to facilitate consistent impact projections from a range of impact models across different sectors (global and regional hydrology, lakes, global crops, global vegetation, regional forests, global and regional marine ecosystems and fisheries, global and regional coastal infrastructure, energy supply and demand, temperature-related mortality, and global terrestrial biodiversity).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Lake Hallstättersee is a holomictic alpine lake, which is influenced by salt mining since the middle Bronze Age. Beside the constant saline waste water load, two massive brine spills loaded the lake with additional 16,900 tons sodium chloride (≈10,250 tons Cl−) from 1977 to 1979 and 3,000 tons salt (≈1,820 tons Cl−) in 2005. The effect of waste water intrusions from salt mining on stratification of Lake Hallstättersee was analysed over a period of 40 years. Water density, dissolved oxygen and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were measured and an exponential model was fitted to describe the wash-out of chloride from Lake Hallstättersee after the brine spills. Furthermore, the time required returning to holomixis and steady chloride content after the second brine spill was estimated. During the whole sampling period the minimum and maximum volume-weighted annual mean chloride concentrations were 23.58 mg/L in 1979 and 3.19 mg/L in 1998. However, the mixing regime of Lake Hallstättersee, as well as the chloride concentrations, varied considerably and exhibited three holomictic and three meromictic periods between 1970 and 2009. Holomictic periods were observed when the yearly density gradient was below 0.06 kg/m3, deepwater oxygen in spring above 4 mg/L and consequently declining TP concentration in the deepest water layer below 60 mg/m3, otherwise meromictic periods were observed. Our study showed that Hallstättersee was 13 years ectogenic meromictic and 27 years holomictic during the study period.},

Salt concentrations measured in 8 streams between 2007 and 2009 ranging in development from pristine to moderate resulted in 4 significantly different groups based on chloride concentrations. Chloride concentrations were significantly correlated to the amount of roadway surface within each sub-watershed, with chloride concentrations in the most impacted stream approaching 200 mg/L. In the more impacted streams, chlor­ide concentrations were significantly and inversely correlated to discharge rate. The high road density around the more developed south end accounted for ∼30\% of the estimated road salt application, which created a chloride gradient within the lake that decreased as water flowed north to the single outlet. The continual and disproportionate input of road salt near the southern end of the lake strengthened the gradient over time to create 4 significantly different regions within the lake. While the consistent lake-wide increase seems to be open-ended, a steady-state salt concentration within the lake may occur in the near future. Based on change of lake chloride mass and export from the lake (2007–2009), an average lake-wide steady-state chloride concentration of ∼17 mg/L is expected, with some variation anticipated due to interannual variation in precipitation and the salt gradient within the lake.},

	abstract = {Saline emissions can elevate water densities and have the potential to alter stratification and mixing dynamics in lakes. In the light of rising anthropogenic salinization of temperate freshwater lakes, it is highly relevant to understand how saline emissions, as well as the rehabilitation from salt pollution might affect lake circulation patterns. In this study, we present the impact of industrial pollution with chloride salts on the deep Alpine lake Traunsee in Austria from 1930 to 2005 and the observed limnological changes during the recovery from salinization in the following 12 years. We assembled and analysed a unique dataset of monthly sampling profiles covering chloride, conductivity, temperature and dissolved oxygen over a 87-year period. We quantified the impact of saline emissions on the lake’s total chloride content, water densities, stability indices and deepwater oxygen concentrations. Time-series of water density profiles and stability indices revealed a significant impact of salinization on seasonal stratification and mixing. Higher dilution and shallower release of saline wastes and the short water retention in Traunsee helped to prevent a long-lasting density stratification. Nevertheless, two periods of salt-induced meromixis occurred in the lake. The first was caused directly by the disposal of saline wastes into the deepwater in the 1930s and 1940s, whereas the second was induced by the recovery from salinization in recent years. The naturally faster wash-out of salts from shallower water layers reinforced the density gradient and impeded vertical water circulation after salt pollution ceased. The rehabilitation from salinization had a stronger effect on stratification intensity and deepwater oxygen concentration than the continuous salt pollution over the last century.},

	abstract = {Meromixis in temperate freshwater lakes is in most cases caused by (1) a morphometric predisposition combined with a high productivity that leads to anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion, (2) saline subsurface inflows, or (3) turbidity currents. Here we report an unusual case where meromixis is caused by the surface inflow of a small tributary. Lej da San Murezzan has been known for several decades to be salinity-stratified during winter, contrary to its neighbouring lakes Lej da Silvaplauna and Lej da Segl. To determine the cause of this stratification, vertical profiles of conductivity were measured on ten occasions between 27 September 2006 and 23 March 2007. An evaluation of these profiles showed that the salinity stratification was continuously built up by a salt source of approximately 5 t d-1. Ovel dal Mulin, a small tributary that contributes only about 1\% to the total water inflows of the lake, was identified as the source of this salt. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a lake where such a small unpolluted surface inflow leads to almost permanent salinity stratification. The salinity stratification has important consequences: it causes the lake to be meromictic with only occasional complete mixing instead of dimictic as the neighbouring lakes and thus supports the build-up of an anoxic bottom layer. Furthermore, it allows restratifying the cold water discharge from a recently installed heat pump within the hypolimnion without the risk of disturbing the ice formation at the lake surface by a rising plume.},

	abstract = {The highest densities of lakes on Earth are in north temperate ecosystems, where increasing urbanization and associated chloride runoff can salinize freshwaters and threaten lake water quality and the many ecosystem services lakes provide. However, the extent to which lake salinity may be changing at broad spatial scales remains unknown, leading us to first identify spatial patterns and then investigate the drivers of these patterns. Significant decadal trends in lake salinization were identified using a dataset of long-term chloride concentrations from 371 North American lakes. Landscape and climate metrics calculated for each site demonstrated that impervious land cover was a strong predictor of chloride trends in Northeast and Midwest North American lakes. As little as 1\% impervious land cover surrounding a lake increased the likelihood of long-term salinization. Considering that 27\% of large lakes in the United States have {\textgreater}1\% impervious land cover around their perimeters, the potential for steady and long-term salinization of these aquatic systems is high. This study predicts that many lakes will exceed the aquatic life threshold criterion for chronic chloride exposure (230 mg L

              ), stipulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the next 50 y if current trends continue.},

In summer, the water columns of all three lakes are distinctly redox stratified, with anoxic hypolimnia and significant accumulation of reduced solutes (e.g., Mn(II), Fe(II), ammonia) in the lake bottom waters. Extremely elevated conductivity, chloride, sodium, and potassium levels are observed in the urban Asylum and Woods Lakes compared to the rural Brewster Lake, presumably due to runoff of road salt deicers applied in the surrounding watershed.

The original analysis predicted a rapid increase in chloride concentrations before reaching a steady steady of 8 mg L−1 by 2020. Forty years of monitoring Sparkling Lake show that rather than reaching a dynamic equilibrium, chloride concentrations have steadily increased. We update the original box model approach by adding a soil reservoir component that shows the slow steady rise in chloride is the result of terrestrial retention. For freshwater rivers and lakes, chloride retention on the landscape will both delay chloride impairment and prolong recovery and must be considered when modeling future chloride contamination risk.},

Time series are developed for the primary cations and anions as well as for specific conductance and alkalinity. When combined with historical estimates, these modern datasets provide a 150-year overview of each lake's chemical makeup. Because of their long residence times, lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron exhibit persistent increases in most ions. For lakes Erie and Ontario, several ions (chloride, sodium, calcium and sulfate), as well as specific conductance, reached peak levels between 1965 and 1975, but then began to decline. The decreases are attributable to different mechanisms: industrial point discharge reductions (sodium, chloride), atmospheric loading declines (sulfate), and the introduction of exotic dreissenid mussels (calcium). Recent data indicate that these ions are now increasing again (chloride, sodium) or have leveled off (calcium, sulfate). The results establish how much the chemical makeup of the Great Lakes has changed due to anthropogenic influences, and underscore the importance of long-term, systematic, water-quality monitoring. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {A new perspective on the severity of aquatic toxicity impact of road salt was gained by a focused research effort directed at winter runoff periods. Dramatic impacts were observed on local, regional, and national scales. Locally, samples from 7 of 13 Milwaukee, Wisconsin area streams exhibited toxicity in Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas bioassays during road-salt runoff. Another Milwaukee stream was sampled from 1996 to 2008 with 72\% of 37 samples exhibiting toxicity in chronic bioassays and 43\% in acute bioassays. The maximum chloride concentration was 7730 mg/L. Regionally, in southeast Wisconsin, continuous specific conductance was monitored as a chloride surrogate in 11 watersheds with urban land use from 6.0 to 100\%. Elevated specific conductance was observed between November and April at all sites, with continuing effects between May and October at sites with the highest specific conductance. Specific conductance was measured as high as 30 800 μS/cm (Cl = 11 200 mg/L). Chloride concentrat...},

	abstract = {Influxes of saline water from roads treated with deicers can alter the density structure of urban lakes. This can diminish or halt turnover events, such that lakes may transition from dimixis to monomixis or meromixis. In nutrient-rich lakes, this lack of turnover can produce persistent hypolimnetic anoxia. We hypothesized that diminished turnover in urban lakes impacted by road salt inputs would lead to increased accumulation of methane in the hypolimnia, with the potential for greater release of methane to the atmosphere via ebullition and from larger storage fluxes of methane when turnover events do occur. The lake water columns of two urban lakes (Woods Lake and Asylum Lake), previously suggested to have transitioned to meromixis and monomixis because of road salt deicer inputs, were sampled monthly from March 2016 to June 2017. A nearby rural lake (North Lake) less likely to be impacted by road salt and maintaining seasonal mixing, was also sampled for comparison. Lake column water was analyzed for conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ferrous iron, manganese, sulfide, calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride and methane concentrations as a function of depth. All three lakes are eutrophic with at least seasonally anoxic hypolimnia. Our data are consistent with prior studies suggesting that Woods Lake has transitioned to meromixis and Asylum Lake to monomixis due to an influx of dense saline water from roads treated with deicers. In contrast, rural North Lake, which had much lower chloride, sodium and conductivity levels, was dimictic. The diminished or absent turnover in the two urban lakes during fall and spring resulted in persistently anoxic, redox-stratified hypolimnia, with much larger accumulations of methane compared to the rural lake. This study demonstrates that road salt deicers impact lake mixing and biogeochemistry, especially methane concentrations, with the potential for significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions from urban lakes.},

Chloride concentrations in most studied streams increased in all seasons (13 of 19 in all seasons; 16 of 19 during winter); maximum concentrations occurred during winter. Increasing concentrations during non-deicing periods suggest that chloride was stored in hydrologic reservoirs, such as the shallow groundwater system, during the winter and slowly released in baseflow throughout the year. Streamflow dependency was also observed with chloride concentrations increasing as streamflow decreased, a result of dilution during rainfall- and snowmelt-induced high-flow periods. The influence of chloride on aquatic life increased with time; 29\% of sites studied exceeded the concentration for the USEPA chronic water quality criteria of 230mg/L by an average of more than 100 individual days per year during 2006–2011. The rapid rate of chloride concentration increase in these streams is likely due to a combination of possible increased road salt application rates, increased baseline concentrations, and greater snowfall in the Midwestern U.S. during the latter portion of the study period.},

Anthropogenic sources of chloride in a lake catchment, including road salt, fertilizer, and wastewater, can elevate the chloride concentration in freshwater lakes above background levels. Rising chloride concentrations can impact lake ecology and ecosystem services such as fisheries and the use of lakes as drinking water sources. To analyze the spatial extent and magnitude of increasing chloride concentrations in freshwater lakes, we amassed a database of 529 lakes in Europe and North America that had greater than or equal to ten years of chloride data. For each lake, we calculated climate statistics of mean annual total precipitation and mean monthly air temperatures from gridded global datasets. We also quantified land cover metrics, including road density and impervious surface, in buffer zones of 100 to 1,500 m surrounding the perimeter of each lake. This database represents the largest global collection of lake chloride data. We hope that long-term water quality measurements in areas outside Europe and North America can be added to the database as they become available in the future.},

	abstract = {The application of road deicing salts has led to the salinization of freshwater ecosystems in northern regions worldwide. Increased chloride concentrations in lakes, streams, ponds, and wetlands may negatively affect freshwater biota, potentially threatening ecosystem services. In an effort to reduce the effects of road salt, operators have increased the use of salt alternatives, yet we lack an understanding of how these deicers affect aquatic communities. We examined the direct and indirect effects of the most commonly used road salt (NaCl) and a proprietary salt mixture (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2), at three environmentally relevant concentrations (150, 470, and 780 mg Cl−/L) on freshwater wetland communities in combination with one of three biotic stressors (control, predator cues, and competitors). The communities contained periphyton, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and two tadpole species (American toads, Anaxyrus americanus; wood frogs, Lithobates sylvaticus). Overall, we found the two road salts did not interact with the natural stressors. Both salts decreased pH and reduced zooplankton abundance. The strong decrease in zooplankton abundance in the highest NaCl concentration caused a trophic cascade that resulted in increased phytoplankton abundance. The highest NaCl concentration also reduced toad activity. For the biotic stressors, predatory stress decreased whereas competitive stress increased the activity of both tadpole species. Wood frog survival, time to metamorphosis, and mass at metamorphosis all decreased under competitive stress whereas toad time to metamorphosis increased and mass at metamorphosis decreased. Road salts and biotic stressors can both affect freshwater communities, but their effects are not interactive.},

Calcium, magnesium, sodium, alkalinity, and hardness significantly increased in the drinking water supply for Baltimore, Maryland over almost 50 years (p {\textless} 0.05) coinciding with regional urbanization. Across a nearby land use gradient at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, there were significant increases in concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, SO42−, Si, and pH with increasing impervious surfaces in 9 streams monitored bi-weekly over a 3–4 year period (p {\textless} 0.05). Base cations in urban streams were up to 60 times greater than forest and agricultural streams, and elemental ratios suggested road salt and carbonate weathering from impervious surfaces as potential sources. Laboratory weathering experiments with concrete also indicated that impervious surfaces increased pH and DIC with potential to alkalinize urban waters. Ratios of Na+ and Cl− suggested that there was enhanced ion exchange in the watersheds from road salts, which could mobilize other base cations from soils to streams. There were significant relationships between Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+ concentrations and Cl−, SO42-, NO3− and DIC across land use (p {\textless} 0.05), which suggested tight coupling of geochemical cycles. Finally, concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, DIC, and pH significantly increased with distance downstream (p {\textless} 0.05) along a stream network draining 170 km2 of the Baltimore LTER site contributing to river alkalinization. Our results suggest that urbanization can dramatically increase major ions, ionic strength, and pH over decades from headwaters to coastal zones, which can impact integrity of aquatic life, infrastructure, drinking water, and coastal ocean alkalinization.},

Mean annual chloride concentration increased as a function of impervious surface and exceeded tolerance for freshwater life in suburban and urban watersheds.

	abstract = {Over 317,000 tonnes of road salt (NaCl) are applied annually for road deicing in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA) of Minnesota. Although road salt is applied to increase driving safety, this practice influences environmental water quality. Thirteen lakes in the TCMA were studied over 46 months to determine if and how they respond to the seasonal applications of road salt. Sodium and chloride concentrations in these lakes were 10 and 25 times higher, respectively, than in other non-urban lakes in the region. Seasonal salinity/chloride cycles in the lakes were correlated with road salt applications: High concentrations in the winter and spring, especially near the bottom of the lakes, were followed by lower concentrations in the summer and fall due to flushing of the lakes by rainfall runoff. The seasonal salt storage/flushing rates for individual lakes were derived from volume-weighted average chloride concentration time series. The rate ranged from 9 to 55\% of a lake's minimum salt content. In some of the lakes studied salt concentrations were high enough to stop spring turnover preventing oxygen from reaching the benthic sediments. Concentrations above the sediments were also high enough to induce convective mixing of the saline water into the sediment pore water. A regional analysis of historical water quality records of 38 lakes in the TCMA showed increases in lake salinity from 1984 to 2005 that were highly correlated with the amount of rock salt purchased by the State of Minnesota. Chloride concentrations in individual lakes were positively correlated with the percent of impervious surfaces in the watershed and inversely with lake volume. Taken together, the results show a continuing degradation of the water quality of urban lakes due to application of NaCl in their watersheds.},

We have characterized the most prevalent natural and anthropogenic sources of Na+ and Cl- in ground water, primarily in Illinois, and explored techniques that could be used to identify their source. We considered seven potential sources that included agricultural chemicals, septic effluent, animal waste, municipal landfill leachate, sea water, basin brines, and road deicers. The halides Cl-, bromide (Br), and iodide (I) were useful indicators of the sources of Na+-Cl- contamination. Iodide enrichment (relative to Cl-) was greatest in precipitation, followed by uncontaminated soil water and ground water, and landfill leachate. The mass ratios of the halides among themselves, with total nitrogen (N), and with Na+ provided diagnostic methods for graphically distinguishing among sources of Na+ and Cl- in contaminated water. Cl/Br ratios relative to Cl- revealed a clear, although overlapping, separation of sample groups. Samples of landfill leachate and ground water known to be contaminated by leachate were enriched in I and Br; this provided an excellent fingerprint for identifying leachate contamination. In addition, total N, when plotted against Cl/Br ratios, successfully separated water contaminated by road salt from water contaminated by other sources.},

	abstract = {Chloride pollution of groundwater and surface water resources is an environmental concern in many regions. While use of road salt for winter road maintenance is known to be a major source of chloride in the environment, limited research has investigated the environmental impacts of chloride discharged from water softeners, particularly in areas with hard water. A chloride budget was developed for the state of Minnesota to estimate the amount of chloride discharged from household water softeners as well as other domestic, agricultural, commercial, and industrial sources. The analysis used multiple data sources, including salt sales records and wastewater monitoring data, and used statistical, spatial, and survey methods to estimate chloride loading from major sources statewide. Annual chloride mass contributions were estimated for the following sources: household water softener use; human excretions; household product use; chloride concentrations in drinking water; atmospheric deposition; road salt use; dust suppressant use; fertilizer application; industrial discharge; and livestock excretions. A mass balance for 96 wastewater treatment plants with effluent monitoring data showed that across these facilities, discharge from water softeners was the largest chloride source. A statewide chloride budget found that road salt was the largest source of chloride to the environment, but that WWTPs and fertilizer were also substantial sources, discharging 221,300 t and 209,900 t annually. Water softeners were estimated to contribute 65\% of the chloride discharged to all 613 municipal WWTPs statewide. Methods used in this analysis could be applied to other communities, watersheds, or states with similar conditions. The results of the analyses indicate that water softening is an important chloride source in areas with hard water and underscore the importance of identifying and characterizing chloride sources in less urban areas, where deicing salt may be a less important contributor and receiving water bodies are often lakes, reservoirs, and streams.},

Our study was designed to evaluate the effects of chloride contamination on urban stormwater pond food webs through changes in zooplankton community composition as well as density and biomass of primary producers and consumers. From May - July 2009, we employed a 2×2×2 full-factorial design to manipulate chloride concentration (low = 177 mg L(-1) Cl(-/)high = 1067 mg L(-1) Cl(-)), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles (presence/absence) and source of stormwater pond algae and zooplankton inoculum (low conductance/high conductance urban ponds) in 40, 600-L mesocosms. Road salt did serve as a constraint on zooplankton community structure, driving community divergence between the low and high chloride treatments. Phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll [a] µg L(-1)) in the mesocosms was significantly greater for the high conductance inoculum (P{\textbackslash}textless0.001) and in the high chloride treatment (P = 0.046), whereas periphyton biomass was significantly lower in the high chloride treatment (P = 0.049). Gray treefrog tadpole time to metamorphosis did not vary significantly between treatments. However, mass at metamorphosis was greater among tadpoles that experienced a faster than average time to metamorphosis and exposure to high chloride concentrations (P = 0.039). Our results indicate differential susceptibility to chloride salts among algal resources and zooplankton taxa, and further suggest that road salts can act as a significant environmental constraint on urban stormwater pond communities.},

	abstract = {Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are commonly measured to compute metabolism of aquatic ecosystems. However, concentrations of DIC and DO depend on many factors in addition to ecosystem metabolism, such as water temperature, gas exchange with the atmosphere, abiotic chemical reactions, and inputs in precipitation, groundwater, and surface water. We used 20-year time series from seven lakes to understand how DIC and DO concentrations are controlled as a function of time scale. Diel cycles of both solutes are controlled primarily by metabolism, exchange with the atmosphere, and temperature. At seasonal and annual scales, metabolism is important, but physical processes associated with spring and autumn mixing, as well as solute loading from the watershed, have comparably large effects. At decadal scales, effects of metabolism are negligible. Controls of the two solutes diverge, with variance in DIC explained largely by solute inputs and variance in DO explained largely by water temperature. Like other indicators in many ecosystems, variability of DIC and DO is strongly scale dependent and associated with different drivers depending on the time scale of the analysis. Key words: aquatic ecosystem metabolism; dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); dissolved oxygen (DO); drivers of DIC and DO; ecosystem drivers; lake concentrations of DIC and DO; long-term ecological research; temporal scale.},

Hypolimnetic enrichment of P was highest in Mendota and Devil’s and least in Fish and Sparkling. This enrichment was attributed mainly to internal loading in the noncalcareous lakes and regeneration of sedimenting epilimnetic P in the calcareous lakes. Differences in Fe scavenging efficiencies at fall turnover were related to hypolimnetic Fe:P molar ratios as well as Fe availability and its control by sulfate–sulfide chemistries. In the noncalcareous lakes with high hypolimnetic Fe enrichment (Fe:P {\textgreater} 2), 45\% of whole-lake total P was removed. P removal was low ({\textless}20\%) in the two calcareous lakes with minimal Fe enrichment (Fe:P {\textless} 2). These differences in hypolimnetic P enrichment and subsequent Fe scavenging at fall turnover help to explain the differences in the amount of P available for subsequent spring and summer primary production as well as the differences in trophic state of the four lakes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            One of the most important physical characteristics driving lifecycle events in lakes is stratification. Already subtle variations in the timing of stratification onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological effects, mainly by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and oxygen to organisms. Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global changes in stratification phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model ensemble and long-term observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, stratification will begin 22.0 ± 7.0 days earlier and end 11.3 ± 4.7 days later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3 ± 11.7 day prolongation in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is also likely.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Water temperatures and stratification are important drivers for ecological and water quality processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (1911–2014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.},

Manipulation of thermal habitat is a potential avenue of exploration for management of invasive species such as the cold-water rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), which has adverse effects on native fish communities in central North American inland lakes. In an effort to test the thermal limits and selectively eradicate rainbow smelt, we experimentally mixed Crystal Lake, Wisconsin, USA, during summer of 2012 and 2013 to warm the hypolimnion and eliminate cold-water habitat. This whole-ecosystem manipulation allowed for field testing of published thermal thresholds reported for rainbow smelt. The rainbow smelt population responded to the thermal manipulation by exhibiting unexpected shifts in behavior, intrapopulation divergence in body condition, and significant population declines. Small individuals of each adult age-class tended to survive the manipulation, and the population persisted despite high mortality rates. Our results indicate a high degree of size-based intrapopulation variation in thermal sensitivity for this species. Our findings also raise questions regarding applicability of lab- and model-derived thermal limits to field scenarios, highlighting a need for further field evaluations of species’ thermal limits.},

	volume = {25},
	doi = {https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1009-2021},
	abstract = {Abstract. The concentration of oxygen is fundamental to lake water quality and ecosystem functioning through its control over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics/nutrient loads, meteorology), as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal time scales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37-year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an evolutionary optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. By quantifying stability indices (Schmidt Stability, Birgean Work, stored internal heat), we identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the inter-annual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regression to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production.) Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50–60 days. The summer heat budget, as well as the timing of thermal stratification, were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. An earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) methylation is a microbially mediated process that converts inorganic Hg into bioaccumulative, neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg). The metabolic activity of methylating organisms is highly dependent on biogeochemical conditions, which subsequently influences MeHg production. However, our understanding of the ecophysiology of methylators in natural ecosystems is still limited. Here, we identified potential locations of MeHg production in the anoxic, sulfidic hypolimnion of a freshwater lake. At these sites, we used shotgun metagenomics to characterize microorganisms with the Hg-methylation gene hgcA. Putative methylators were dominated by hgcA sequences divergent from those in well-studied, confirmed methylators. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we identified organisms with hgcA (hgcA+) within the Bacteroidetes and the recently described Kiritimatiellaeota phyla. We identified hgcA+ genomes derived from sulfate-reducing bacteria, but these accounted for only 22\% of hgcA+ genome coverage. The most abundant hgcA+ genomes were from fermenters, accounting for over half of the hgcA gene coverage. Many of these organisms also mediate hydrolysis of polysaccharides, likely from cyanobacterial blooms. This work highlights the distribution of the Hg-methylation genes across microbial metabolic guilds and indicate that primary degradation of polysaccharides and fermentation may play an important but unrecognized role in MeHg production in the anoxic hypolimnion of freshwater lakes.},

The investigation was conducted on a heterogeneous assemblage of sediments and in two solutions differing fundamentally in the presence (2.3 mg l−1) and absence of K. Both biomass production and shoot morphology in Hydrilla varied significantly between solutions and among sediments. In contrast to N and P, which were readily mobilized from most sediments, K was mobilized from all sediments to only a minor extent by this species. Mobilization of K was proportional to interstitial water K concentration; yet on at least four of the six sediments examined, K supplied from sediments was insufficient to support the maximal growth of Hydrilla. The open water rather than the sediment appears to be the primary source of K supply to this species and perhaps to most other submersed freshwater macrophytes. Where K was supplied in solution, sediment-related differences in the growth of Hydrilla negatively correlated with sediment organic matter content over the range 0.2–56.2\% dry sediment mass. It is tentatively suggested that the organic composition of sediments may influence the species composition of aquatic macrophyte communities.},

	abstract = {I examined the effects of an early fall (8-10 September 1977) cold front on eutrophic Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, during which 'Lake Number' L N (dimensionless) attained a minimum 3 h value of 0.45, and remained below 1.0 for a total of 39 h. The front accelerated heat transport downward through the main thermocline, resulting in hypolimnetic warming; the vertical eddy conductivity Kz increased monotonically with depth from a minimum 0.8 m2 day-I at 16 m to 1.9 m2 day-I at 21 m. The front also affected significant lateral and vertical redistribution of three passive solute 'tracers': phosphate (P), silicic acid (Si) and soluble reduced manganese (Mn2+). Lateral concentration gradients along isopycnals predating the storm were erased. For Mn, especially, the vertical redistribution within the hypolimnion agreed with modeled changes based on vertical gradients and the Kz profile. Mn and P behaved quasi-conservatively within the anoxic hypolimnion (no net sources or sinks), but additional supplies of Si appeared in the hypolimnion (8.0 ± 1.5 mg m -3 day-I ). This rate over 4 days agreed with the mean rate of hypolimnetic Si accumulation over the 80 day interval preceding 7 September 1977 (8.7 mg m-3 day -1 ). These results corroborate other environmental evidence that Mn and P both enter Lake Mendota's hypolimnion mainly during the first half of the summer, prior to the onset of bulk hypolimnetic anoxia, whereas Si is released by hypolimnetic sediments continuing into the late summer.},

Downriver, most soluble elements increase (Ba, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Rb, S, and Sr) while statistically significant decreases in insoluble elements (Al, Ce, Dy, Er, Fe, Gd, La, Mn, Nd, Pr, and Y) also occur. Lithium, Si, and Zr did not show a consistent increasing or decreasing trend. Concentrations of most elements measured on June 5, 2008 were greater than 7 weeks later; however, greater discharge and lower pH enhanced Al concentrations occurred during the later sampling date. Elemental ratios track changes in lithology, anthropogenic influence, and pH. The Raquette River shows the least variation in elemental concentrations because of storage in numerous hydropower reservoirs and has non-detectable concentrations of some redox sensitive elements such as Co, Ni, and V. Oswegatchie tributaries display similar geochemical trends dependent upon their location and local bedrock and show geochemical trends along the trunks of major rivers that are also evident in smaller drainage basins. Comparison with analytical results from the Western Adirondack Stream Survey also indicates acidification is prevalent in the Adirondack Highlands, particularly in the Oswegatchie headwaters during periods of high flow, but acidity is rapidly buffered downriver due to interaction with marble in the Adirondack Lowlands.},

Researchers at the US Geological Survey have used a wide range of historical data sources and a spatially explicit modeling framework to model spatially explicit historical LULC change in the conterminous United States from 1992 back to 1938. Annual LULC maps were produced at 250-m resolution, with 14 LULC classes. Assessment of model results showed good agreement with trends and spatial patterns in historical data sources such as the Census of Agriculture and historical housing density data, although comparison with historical data is complicated by deﬁnitional and methodological diﬀerences. The completion of this dataset allows researchers to assess historical LULC impacts on a range of ecological processes.},

	abstract = {Influxes of saline water from roads treated with deicers can alter the density structure of urban lakes. This can diminish or halt turnover events, such that lakes may transition from dimixis to monomixis or meromixis. In nutrient-rich lakes, this lack of turnover can produce persistent hypolimnetic anoxia. We hypothesized that diminished turnover in urban lakes impacted by road salt inputs would lead to increased accumulation of methane in the hypolimnia, with the potential for greater release of methane to the atmosphere via ebullition and from larger storage fluxes of methane when turnover events do occur. The lake water columns of two urban lakes (Woods Lake and Asylum Lake), previously suggested to have transitioned to meromixis and monomixis because of road salt deicer inputs, were sampled monthly from March 2016 to June 2017. A nearby rural lake (North Lake) less likely to be impacted by road salt and maintaining seasonal mixing, was also sampled for comparison. Lake column water was analyzed for conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ferrous iron, manganese, sulfide, calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride and methane concentrations as a function of depth. All three lakes are eutrophic with at least seasonally anoxic hypolimnia. Our data are consistent with prior studies suggesting that Woods Lake has transitioned to meromixis and Asylum Lake to monomixis due to an influx of dense saline water from roads treated with deicers. In contrast, rural North Lake, which had much lower chloride, sodium and conductivity levels, was dimictic. The diminished or absent turnover in the two urban lakes during fall and spring resulted in persistently anoxic, redox-stratified hypolimnia, with much larger accumulations of methane compared to the rural lake. This study demonstrates that road salt deicers impact lake mixing and biogeochemistry, especially methane concentrations, with the potential for significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions from urban lakes.},

	abstract = {Salt pollution and human-accelerated weathering are shifting the chemical composition of major ions in fresh water and increasing salinization and alkalinization across North America. We propose a concept, the freshwater salinization syndrome, which links salinization and alkalinization processes. This syndrome manifests as concurrent trends in specific conductance, pH, alkalinity, and base cations. Although individual trends can vary in strength, changes in salinization and alkalinization have affected 37\% and 90\%, respectively, of the drainage area of the contiguous United States over the past century. Across 232 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring sites, 66\% of stream and river sites showed a statistical increase in pH, which often began decades before acid rain regulations. The syndrome is most prominent in the densely populated eastern and midwestern United States, where salinity and alkalinity have increased most rapidly. The syndrome is caused by salt pollution (e.g., road deicers, irrigation runoff, sewage, potash), accelerated weathering and soil cation exchange, mining and resource extraction, and the presence of easily weathered minerals used in agriculture (lime) and urbanization (concrete). Increasing salts with strong bases and carbonates elevate acid neutralizing capacity and pH, and increasing sodium from salt pollution eventually displaces base cations on soil exchange sites, which further increases pH and alkalinization. Symptoms of the syndrome can include: infrastructure corrosion, contaminant mobilization, and variations in coastal ocean acidification caused by increasingly alkaline river inputs. Unless regulated and managed, the freshwater salinization syndrome can have significant impacts on ecosystem services such as safe drinking water, contaminant retention, and biodiversity.},

The moraine underlies an extensive urban and industrial landscape, which draws its water supply from {\textgreater}20 wellfields, several of which are approaching or have exceeded the drinking water limit for chloride. The study investigates the mechanisms of road salt infiltration, storage, and transport in the subsurface and assesses the effectiveness of mitigation measures designed to reduce the impact. The three-dimensional transport model accounts for increases in salt loading, as well as growth of the urbanized area and road network over the past 50 years. The simulations, which focus on one impacted wellfield, show chloride plumes originating mainly at arterial roads and migrating through aquitard windows into the water supply aquifers. The results suggest that the aquifer system contains a large and heterogeneously distributed mass of chloride and that concentrations in the aquifer can be substantially higher than the concentrations in the well water. Future impact scenarios indicate that although the system responds rapidly to reductions in salt loading, the residual chloride mass may take decades to flush out, even if road salting were discontinued. The implications with respect to urban wellfields in typical snow-belt areas are discussed.},

Road salt has resulted in the salinization of surface waters across temperate North America. Increasingly, road salt is recognized as a significant regional pollutant in the Adirondack Park. Here we analyze biweekly limnological data from Mirror Lake (Lake Placid, NY) to understand the role of road salt runoff in an apparent lack of spring mixing in 2017. Water column profile data show notable spatial and temporal variability in chloride concentrations within the lake. Concentrations are highest at the lake bottom during the winter, with increases associated with the onset of road salt application to the watershed. High chloride concentrations in the hypolimnion persisted through the summer of 2017 due to a lack of complete spring mixing as the result of road salt induced density differences within the water column. Water density calculations and Schmidt stability point to an increase in water column stability due to the accumulation of salt at the lake bottom. The incomplete spring mixing resulted in greater spatial and temporal extent of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion, reducing habitat availability for lake trout. Restoration of lake mixing would occur rapidly upon significant reduction of road salt application to the watershed and improvements in stormwater management.},

	abstract = {Sodium affects the metabolism of eukaryotes and prokaryotes in several ways. This review collates information on the effects of Na+ on the metabolism of cyanobacteria with emphasis on the N2,fixing filamentous species. Na+ is required for nitrogenase activity inAnabaena torulosa, Anabaena L-31 andPlectonema boryanum. The features of this requirement have been mainly studied inAnabaena torulosa. The need for Na+ is specific and cannot be replaced by K+, Li+, Ca 2 + or Mg2+. Processes crucial for expression of nitrogenase such as molybdenum uptake, protection of the enzyme from oxygen inactivation and conformational activation of the enzyme are not affected by Na+. Mo-Fe protein and Fe protein, the two components of nitrogenase are synthesized in the absence of Na+ but the enzyme complex is catalytically inactive. Photoevolution of O2 and CO2 fixation, which are severely inhibited in the absence of Na+, are quickly restored by glutamine or glutamate indicating that Na+ deprivation affects photosynthesis indirectly due to deficiency in the products of N2 fixation. Na+ deprivation decreases phosphate uptake, nucleoside phosphate pool and nitrogenase activity. These effects are reversed by the addition of Na+ suggesting that a limitation of available ATP caused by reduced phosphate uptake results in loss of nitrogenase activity during Na+ starvation.},

We transformed a mutant impaired in CO2 uptake and in cmpA–D encoding a HCO3−transporter with a transposon inactivation library, and we recovered mutants unable to take up HCO3− and grow in low CO2 at pH 9.0. They are all tagged within slr1512 (designated sbtA). We show that SbtA-mediated transport is induced by low CO2, requires Na+, and plays the major role in HCO3− uptake in Synechocystis. Inactivation of slr1509 (homologous to ntpJ encoding a Na+/K+-translocating protein) abolished the ability of cells to grow at [Na+] higher than 100 mm and severely depressed the activity of the SbtA-mediated HCO3− transport. We propose that the SbtA-mediated HCO3− transport is driven by ΔμNa+ across the plasma membrane, which is disrupted by inactivating ntpJ. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that two types of sbtA exist in various cyanobacterial strains, all of which possess ntpJ. The sbtA gene is the first one identified as essential to Na+-dependent HCO3− transport in photosynthetic organisms and may play a crucial role in carbon acquisition when CO2 supply is limited, or in Prochlorococcus strains that do not possess CO2uptake systems or Cmp-dependent HCO3− transport.},

Feedbacks among ecosystem dynamics, human uses, economics, social dynamics, and policy and practice are fundamental to understanding change in these lake districts.

In this context, we analyzed the agricultural, urbanizing Yahara watershed (size: 1345 km², population: 372,000) to assess its responses to multiple changing drivers. We measured recent trends in land use/cover and water quality of the watershed, spatial patterns of 10 ecosystem services, and spatial patterns and nestedness of governance. We developed scenarios for the future of the Yahara watershed by integrating trends and events from the global scenarios literature, perspectives of stakeholders, and models of biophysical drivers and ecosystem services. Four qualitative scenarios were created to explore plausible trajectories to the year 2070 in the watershed’s social-ecological system under different regimes: no action on environmental trends, accelerated technological development, strong intervention by government, and shifting values toward sustainability. Quantitative time-series for 2010–2070 were developed for weather and land use/cover during each scenario as inputs to model changes in ecosystem services. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how changes in the social-ecological system of the Yahara watershed, including management of land and water resources, can build or impair resilience to shifting drivers, including climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Water temperatures and stratification are important drivers for ecological and water quality processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (1911–2014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.},

	abstract = {Historical ice records, such as freeze and breakup dates and the total duration of ice cover, can be used as a quantitative indicator of climatic change if long homogeneous records exist and if the records can be calibrated in terms of climatic changes. Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, has the longest uninterrupted ice records available for any lake in North America dating back to 1855. These records extend back prior to any reliable air temperature data in the midwestern region of the U.S. and demonstrate significant warming of approximately 1.5 {\textasciitilde} in fall and early winter temperatures and 2.5 {\textasciitilde} in winter and spring temperatures during the past 135 years. These changes are not completely monotonic, but rather appear as two shorter periods of chmatic change in the longer record. The first change was between 1875 and 1890, when fall, winter, and spring air temperatures increased by approximately 1.5 *C. The second change, earlier ice breakup dates since 1979, was caused by a significant increase in winter and early spring air temperatures of approximately 1.3 {\textasciitilde} This change may be indicative of shifts in regional climatic patterns associated with global warming, possibly associated with the 'Greenhouse Effect: With the relationships between air temperature and freeze and break up dates, we can project how the ice cover of Lake Mendota should respond to future climatic changes. If warming occurs, the ice cover for Lake Mendota should decrease approximately 11 days per 1 {\textasciitilde} increase. With a warming of 4 to 5 {\textasciitilde} years with no ice cover should occur in approximately 1 out of 15 to 30 years.},

The system infrastructure comprises a web portal to retrieve and display observations that are used to drive models under a high performance computing server. Water level and flow discharge information are obtained from a suite of models that be directly simulate the RCL system. A new data assimilation technique based upon flow routing algorithm and nested-mesh domain reduction is developed to update the Manning’s roughness. It is demonstrated that the INFOS can reliably and effectively model real-time reverse flows due to sustained wind forcings or tranisent seiches, and flow choking due to channel constriction. Applications of the developed system are illustrated. Specifically water level planning scenarios provide a quantitative measure for lake management to reduce floods under extreme rainfall events. Alternative management philosophies to minimize exceeding the water level orders are evaluated. Overall, the Integrated Nowcast and Forecast Operation System (INFOS) provides reliable and timely water information for the RCL for sharing information to the community, planning for water use and delivery, and management of the Yahara RCL.},

	abstract = {Human impacts on freshwater ecosystems are pervasive, but the short and discontinuous nature of most datasets limits our ability to understand the controls on water quality and effectively manage freshwater resources. We examine change in Lake Mendota (Madison, Wisconsin) over the last two centuries by pairing analyses of a sedimentary archive with the site’s {\textgreater} 100 yr limnological record. We show that eutrophication of the lake, evident as an abrupt shift in sediment composition, began in the late 19th century following the intensiﬁcation of urban and agricultural land use in the watershed. Efforts to address deterioration of lake water quality, including the removal of point-source pollutants and biomanipulation, have had a measurable inﬂuence on sediment composition and water clarity. Since the early 1980s, quasi-seasonal cycles of phytoplankton blooms have induced calcite precipitation, leaving distinct laminations in the sedimentary record. These “whiting events” evidently did not accumulate in lake sediments until the late 20th century, indicating that efforts to remediate water quality have shifted the lake to a new ecosystem state. Calcite whitings can improve water quality in eutrophic lakes by coprecipitation with phosphate, increasing phosphorus (P) burial in lake sediments. Using long-term limnological records, we report negative correlations between calcite saturation indices and P in lake surface waters and show that calcite whitings could partially explain recent P decline in Lake Mendota surface waters. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized potential control on water quality in this eutrophic lake and demonstrates the beneﬁt of coupling long-term limnological data with sedimentary records.},

	abstract = {The forms and distribution of sulfur in the black bottom muds of Lake Mendota have been determined and the data combined with available background information to gain understanding of sulfur metabolism in a freshwater sulfuretum and of the generic relationships among various forms of sulfur. The suite of sulfur compounds in the lake sediments is made up of sulfide dissolved in the interstitial water, acid-volatile sulfide, elemental sulfur, organic sulfur, and sulfates. The dominant form of sulfur in the sludge is a black, amorphous, acid-soluble substance believed to be hydrotroilite. No pyrite or marcasite was isolated from these bottom muds. Nearly 45\% of the sulfur precipitated as sulfide is apparently derived from mineralization of organic matter with the remaining fraction coming from bacterial reduction of sulfates. The sulfur analyses coupled with other evidence suggest that prior to the change in sedimentation in Lake Mendota associated with human activity the lake had developed an oxygen deficiency intense enough to cause the reduction of sulfates to sulfides but was able to maintain its basin free of black muds by processes of self-purification.},

Theoretical mechanisms generating frequent extremes apply to both environmental and biological processes, yet past studies of ecological extremes have focused primarily on the abiotic environment. The rarity or commonness of extremes in biological time series is unknown. We evaluated the statistical tendency to produce extreme events in 595 biological, chemical, physical, and meteorological time series taken from 11 lakes. We found that extreme events were much more likely to occur for biological variables than for other categories. Additional analysis revealed that the tendency to produce extremes was driven primarily by within-year dynamics, suggesting that processes occurring at short time scales underlie the high frequency of extremes in biological variables. These results should lead us to expect surprises in long-term observations of biological populations.},

	abstract = {Aim To review and synthesize multiple lines of evidence that describe the spatial patterns of land use associated with prehistoric and early historical Native American societies in eastern North America in order to better characterize the type, spatial extent and temporal persistence of past land use. Location Temperate forests of eastern North America, and the Eastern Woodlands cultural region. Methods Ethnohistorical accounts, archaeological data, historical land surveys and palaeoecological records describing indigenous forms of silviculture and agriculture were evaluated across scales ranging from local (100 km) to regional (102 km) to produce a synthetic description of land-use characteristics. Results Indigenous land-use practices created patches of distinct ecological conditions within a heterogeneous mosaic of ecosystem types. At all scales, patch location was dynamic, and patches underwent recurrent periods of expansion, contraction and abandonment. Land-use patches varied in their extent and persistence, and are broadly categorized as silvicultural (management of undomesticated woodland taxa) or agricultural (cultivation of domesticated taxa). Silvicultural patches persisted for centuries and extended kilometres to tens of kilometres around settlements and travel corridors. The dynamics of agricultural patches varied among groups, with persistence ranging from decades to centuries and extent ranging from less than a kilometre to tens of kilometres around settlements. Beyond patch boundaries, human impacts on ecosystems become indistinguishable from other drivers of environmental heterogeneity. These characteristics of patches are evident across scales and multiple lines of evidence. Main conclusions Our findings challenge the view that prehistoric human impacts on vegetation were widespread and ubiquitous, and build on previous work showing these impacts to be more localized and heterogeneous by providing quantitative descriptions of land-use patch characteristics. Collaborative efforts that combine multiple data sources are needed to refine these descriptions and generate more precise measures of land-use pattern to further investigate the history of human impacts on the Earth system.},

We quantiﬁed the linkage between extreme daily precipitation and extreme daily discharge, phosphorus (P) load, and P concentration for Pheasant Branch and the Yahara River, two tributaries of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, U.S.A. using the generalized Pareto distribution. Although precipitation extremes have increased since 1940, over the shorter period of stream monitoring (1994–2015 for Pheasant Branch and 1991–2015 for Yahara) there is no signiﬁcant trend in extreme precipitation. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of extreme precipitation events (for example seven of the 11 largest 24-h events since 1901) occurred during the period of stream monitoring. Daily precipitation extremes were associated with extremes in daily discharge and P load. P load return levels increased steeply and almost linearly with precipitation on log-log axes. The trend toward more frequent and intense precipitation extremes will increase P loading and intensify the eutrophication of the lake, unless the excessive P enrichment of the watershed is reversed.},

              Harmful blooms of the filamentous cyanobacteria
              Planktothrix rubescens
              have become common in many lakes as they have recovered from eutrophication over the last decades. These cyanobacteria, capable of regulating their vertical position, often flourish at the thermocline to form a deep chlorophyll maximum. In Lake Zurich (Switzerland), they accumulate during stratified season (May–October) as a persistent metalimnetic thin layer ({\textasciitilde}2 m wide). This study investigated the role of turbulent mixing in springtime layer formation, its persistence over the summer, and its breakdown in autumn. We characterised seasonal variation of turbulence in Lake Zurich with four surveys conducted in April, July and October of 2018 and September of 2019. Surveys included microstructure profiles and high-resolution mooring measurements. In July and October, the thin layer occurred within a strong thermocline (

               cm). Consistently, vertical diffusivity was close to molecular values, indicating negligible turbulent fluxes. This reduced metalimnetic mixing explains the persistence of the thin layer, which disappears with the deepening of the surface mixed layer in autumn. Bi-weekly temperature profiles in 2018 and a nighttime microstructure sampling in September 2019 showed that nighttime convection serves as the main mechanism driving the breakdown of the cyanobacterial layer in autumn. These results highlight the importance of light winds and convective mixing in the seasonal cycling of

Warmer temperatures and lower wind speeds increased the size and duration of hypoxic and anoxic regions by lengthening the stratified period. Decreased wind speed increased hypolimnion thickness while decreasing its temperature and DO consumption rate. Decreased TP loading improved DO conditions with a reduction of 75\% effectively abolishing hypoxia. Anoxia was more sensitive to air temperature, wind and nutrient changes than was hypoxia. New metrics that capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of low DO conditions were more sensitive than the commonly-cited maximum areas of hypoxia or anoxia. Over most of the relevant range of forcing factors, the simple and first order effect of a 1 °C temperature change was equivalent to a 10-14\% change in TP loads, while a 1\% change in wind speed was equivalent to a 2-3\% change in TP loads. Reduced ice cover in warmer climates will likely increase air temperature effects even further.},

The disk is circular, 20 cm in diameter, and has alternating black and white quadrants. It is lowered using a calibrated Kevlar rope to minimize stretching. Readings are made on the shaded side of the boat both with and without the aid of a plexiglass viewer. The points at which the disk disappears while being lowered and reappears while being raised are averaged to determine Secchi depth. Auxiliary data include time of day, air temperature, cloud cover, wave height, wind speed and direction and whether the lake was ice covered on the sampledate. Sampling Frequency: fortnightly during ice-free season - every 6 weeks during ice-covered season for the northern lakes. The southern lakes are similar except that sampling occurs monthly during the fall and typically only once during the winter (depending on ice conditions). Number of sites: 11},

	abstract = {A common perception in limnology is that shallow lakes are homogeneously mixed owing to their small water volume. However, this perception is largely gained by downscaling knowledge from large lakes to their smaller counterparts. Here we show that shallow vegetated lakes (less than 0.6 m), in fact, undergo recurring daytime stratification and nocturnal mixing accompanied by extreme chemical variations during summer. Dense submerged vegetation effectively attenuates light and turbulence generating separation between warm surface waters and much colder bottom waters. Photosynthesis in surface waters produces oxygen accumulation and CO
              2
              depletion, whereas respiration in dark bottom waters causes anoxia and CO
              2
              accumulation. High daytime pH in surface waters promotes precipitation of CaCO
              3
              which is re-dissolved in bottom waters. Nocturnal convective mixing re-introduces oxygen into bottom waters for aerobic respiration and regenerated inorganic carbon into surface waters, which supports intense photosynthesis. Our results reconfigure the basic understanding of local environmental gradients in shallow lakes, one of the most abundant freshwater habitats globally.},

During the 20 days of experiments, the oxygen consumption varied from 4.5 mg.l-1 (tannic acid) to 71.5 mg.l-1 (glucose). The highest deoxygenation rate (kD) was observed for mineralization of tannic acid (0.321 day-1) followed by glycine, starch, lysine, sucrose and glucose (0.1004, 0.0504, 0.0486, 0.0251 and 0.0158 day-1, respectively).

	abstract = {Recent literature has suggested that for many lakes and rivers, the respiratory breakdown of organic matter (R) exceeds production of organic matter by photosynthesis (gross primary production [GPP]) within the water body. This metabolic balance (GPP {\textgreater} R; “heterotrophy”) implies that allochthonous organic matter supports a portion of the aquatic ecosystem's respiration. Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of lake types studied, especially with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are two reasons for differing conclusions. We deployed O2 and CO2 sondes to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 lakes. From these data, we calculated GPP, R, and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP − R). Over the broad range in TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O2 changed on a near 1 : 1 molar ratio. Metabolism estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set had negative NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were nearly equal, but, at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had negative NEP. Strong correlations between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon influences lake metabolism.},

This study used high-frequency data from 15 lakes provided by the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) to study how model choice of k influenced estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere. We tested 6 models of k on lakes chosen to span broad gradients in surface area and trophic states; a metabolism model was then fit to all 6 outputs of k data. We found that hourly values for k were substantially different between models and, at an annual scale, resulted in significantly different estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere.},

To do so, this study integrated 6 yr of eddy-covariance flux tower observations of lake-atmosphere fluxes with high-frequency observations of in-lake temperature, dissolved oxygen, and partial pressure of CO2, for a eutrophic lake in Wisconsin, U.S.A. While growing season fluxes are variable and switch between source and sink, annual net carbon fluxes show the lake acts as an annual sink of carbon, with the magnitude depending on climate, along with the timing and strength of fall turnover, with half of the total annual carbon uptake happening in October and November.},

	abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) for up to a full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0.1 to 5.0 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5\% to 85\% of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Background respiration ranged from 0.017 to 2.1 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and was positively related to indicators of recalcitrant allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter loads, but was not clearly related to an indicator of the quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs.},

	abstract = {To characterize the spatial variability of metabolism estimates (gross primary production [GPP], respiration [R], and net ecosystem production [NEP]) in two Northern Wisconsin lakes, we collected data from 27 and 35 dissolved oxygen sensors placed in a two-dimensional array throughout the upper mixed layers over a period of 10 d per lake in midsummer. Averaged over the deployment, aerial metabolism estimates among sensor locations varied 1–2 orders of magnitude and were largely unrelated to physical habitat within the lake. For all sites and days, 76–90\% of the explainable variance in GPP and R was attributable to location in the lake rather than day of the deployment. NEP, on the other hand, was less affected by location, with 79–93\% of the explained variance attributable to the day of the deployment. Single-location estimates can yield errors of more than an order of magnitude in estimates of daily GPP and R and can mischaracterize the trophic status of the lake. Using a rarefaction approach, we found that using four randomly placed sensors increased the precision of the resulting daily metabolism estimates fourfold over single-location measures in both lakes.},

	abstract = {Free-water measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) in lakes are becoming common and provide opportunities for estimating ecosystem processes, such as gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R). The models used to estimate metabolism often subsume biological processes into one parameter each for GPP and R. However, high-frequency DO observations made over days show diverse patterns at multiple time scales, suggesting a complex suite of processes controls DO dynamics. Can we improve metabolism estimates and predictive ability for DO at diel scales by adding complexity to the models? In this study, we use data from two north temperate lakes to test a variety of metabolism models representing a suite of non-linear metabolic processes. To test whether alternative models can be discriminated, we simulated DO with assumed parameter values and auto-regressive noise, and fit the models to the simulated DO. The most complex model could be discriminated from simpler models and provided the most accurate and precise predictions. However, when models were fit to observed DO data from the sensor network, the simplest model predicted DO as well as the most complex one. The added complexity did not improve model performance. An analysis of the model residuals indicates that physics may explain some of the DO pattern not predicted, especially high-frequency oscillations and anomalies that appear to coincide with weather patterns. Under reasonably stable weather conditions and at scales of a few days, simple metabolism models explain the bulk of diel DO variability.},

	abstract = {We quantify the allochthonous organic carbon (OC) budgets for seven north temperate lakes, using diverse information about their land cover, hydrology, and limnological characteristics. We develop a simple equilibrium model within a Bayesian framework that exploits the differences among the lakes to estimate three key rates: aerial loading (AOC) and wetland loading (WOC) from adjacent ecosystems and whole-lake mineralization of OC (RDOC). Combined with observational data, these rates allow for estimates of the total OC loads, mineralization, and sedimentation within lakes and export to downstream ecosystems. AOC was 1.15 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, WOC ranged from 0.72 to 3.00 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, and RDOC, normalized to 20°C, ranged from 0.00083 to 0.0015 d−1. Total loads ranged from about 5 to 55 g C m−2 yr−1. Ecosystems immediately adjacent to lakes accounted for one-half or more of total OC loads for some lakes. Whether a lake processed and stored more allochthonous OC than it exported depended primarily on hydrologic residence time. Our equilibrium model provides a parsimonious approach to quantifying allochthonous OC budgets in lakes with relatively minimal baseline data.},

	abstract = {The Livingstone and Imboden (1996) model for the oxygen depletion rate in lake hypolimnia was evaluated with field results in 32 lakes. The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

	abstract = {The development of complete regional carbon (C) budgets for different biomes is an integral step in the effort to predict global response and potential feedbacks to a changing climate regime. Wetland and lake contributions to regional C cycling remain relatively uncertain despite recent research highlighting their importance. Using a combination of field surveys and tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, modeling, and published literature, we constructed a complete C budget for the Northern Highlands Lake District in northern Wisconsin/Michigan, a ∼6400 km2 region rich in lakes and wetlands. This is one of the first regional C budgets to incorporate aquatic and terrestrial C cycling under the same framework. We divided the landscape into three major compartments (forests, wetlands, and surface waters) and quantified all major C fluxes into and out of those compartments, with a particular focus on atmospheric exchange but also including sedimentation in lakes and hydrologic fluxes. Landscape C storage was dominated by peat-containing wetlands and lake sediments, which make up only 20\% and 13\% of the landscape area, respectively, but contain {\textgreater}80\% of the total fixed C pool (ca. 400 Tg). We estimated a current regional C accumulation of 1.1±0.1 Tg yr−1, and the largest regional flux was forest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into aggrading forests for a total of 1.0±0.1 Tg yr−1. Mean wetland NEE (0.12±0.06 Tg yr−1 into wetlands), lake CO2 emissions and riverine efflux (each ca. 0.03±0.01 Tg yr−1) were smaller but of consequence to the overall budget. Hydrologic transport from uplands/wetlands to surface waters within the region was an important vector of terrestrial C. Regional C fluxes and pools would be misrepresented without inclusion of surface waters and wetlands, and C budgets in heterogeneous landscapes open opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important fluxes to changes in climate and land use/land cover.},

We fit Bayesian hierarchical models to thousands of observations from over two decades to quantify four components of variation – spatial (local and regional) and temporal (local and coherent); and to model their drivers. We found strong support for three propositions: (1) spatial variation at local and regional scales are large and roughly equal, (2) annual temporal variation is mostly local rather than coherent, and, (3) spatial variation exceeds temporal variation. Our findings imply that predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes at macroscales requires consideration of the dominant spatial signals at both local and regional scales that may overwhelm temporal signals.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 °C during the test period (DL: 1.78 °C, PB: 2.03 °C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.},

These spanned the range of hydrologic settings in the region, including hydraulically mounded, groundwater flowthrough, and groundwater-discharge lakes. Parallel increases in concentration across the seven lakes during drought were attributable to evapoconcentration. However, we observed divergent trends for mass, which better reflects altered solute flux by accounting for changes in lake volume. Ca+Mg mass increased in three groundwater-dominated lakes as precipitation inputs were low and groundwater discharging from longer flowpaths became proportionately more important. In contrast, decreases in Ca+Mg mass for two precipitation-dominated lakes reflected diminished inputs of solute-rich groundwater. Landscape position, defined by the spatial position of a lake within a hydrologic flow system, accounted for the divergence in chemical responses to drought.},

Coherent decreases in thermocline depth and increases in hypolimnetic volume, mean hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and VWHO were observed in ﬁve of the six study lakes. All lakes underwent an abrupt increase in VWHO and mean hypolimnetic DO after 2010. In four of the six study lakes, the highest hypolimnetic DO concentrations were observed in years where chlorophyll a concentrations were low, whereas at ﬁve of the six study lakes the highest hypolimnetic volumes were observed when dissolved organic carbon concentrations were relatively high. Warmer spring or winter air temperatures were associated with higher hypolimnetic DO concentrations at two sites, and longer ice-free periods were associated with smaller hypolimnetic volumes at two sites. These results suggest that the recent VWHO increases in the studied south-central Ontario lakes may be a function of multiple drivers that include changes in primary production, lake water transparency, and regional climatic factors.},

	abstract = {Respiration, photosynthetic production, and diffusion interact to produce the daily curve of oxygen change in a segment of flowing water. Conversely, the observed curves of oxygen in streams can be used to calculate the component rates of production, respiration, and diffusion. New production values obtained with these analyses of oxygen curves from various sources, as well as a few previously existing estimates of primary production, indicate a generally higher rate of production in flowing waters than in other types of aquatic environments. The ratio of total primary production to total community respiration is used to classify communities quantitatively according to their predominantly heterotrophic or autotrophic characteristics. Longitudinal succession within a stream tends to modify the ratio towards unity from higher values for autotrophic and from lower values for heterotrophic communities. The behavior of this ratio is described for the annual cycle in a stream, for the sequence of pollution recovery, and for diverse types of communities.},

Novel mathematical analysis of ecological dynamics permits a process-based understanding of conditions under which systems approach equilibrium, experience large oscillations, or persist in transient states. This understanding is improved by combining ecological models with empirical observations from a variety of sources. Bayesian hierarchical models explicitly couple process-based models and data, yielding probabilistic quantification of model parameters, system characteristics, and associated uncertainties. We outline relevant tools from dynamical analysis and hierarchical modeling and argue for their integration, demonstrating the value of this synthetic approach through a simple predator–prey example.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the production and consumption of organic material have been a focus of aquatic science for more than 80 years. Over the last century, a variety of approaches have been developed and employed for measuring rates of gross primary production (Pg), respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (Pn = Pg − R) within aquatic ecosystems. Here, we reconsider the range of approaches and applications for ecosystem metabolism measurements, and suggest ways by which such studies can continue to contribute to aquatic ecology. This paper reviews past and contemporary studies of aquatic ecosystem-level metabolism to identify their role in understanding and managing aquatic systems. We identify four broad research objectives that have motivated ecosystem metabolism studies: (1) quantifying magnitude and variability of metabolic rates for cross-system comparison, (2) estimating organic matter transfer between adjacent systems or subsystems, (3) measuring ecosystem-scale responses to perturbation, both natural and anthropogenic, and (4) quantifying and calibrating models of biogeochemical processes and trophic networks. The magnitudes of whole-system gross primary production, respiration and net ecosystem production rates vary among aquatic environments and are partly constrained by the chosen methodology. We argue that measurements of ecosystem metabolism should be a vital component of routine monitoring at larger scales in the aquatic environment using existing flexible, precise, and durable sensor technologies. Current and future aquatic ecosystem studies will benefit from application of new methods for metabolism measurements, which facilitate integration of process measurements and calibration of models for addressing fundamental questions involving ecosystem-scale processes.},

Warmer temperatures and lower wind speeds increased the size and duration of hypoxic and anoxic regions by lengthening the stratified period. Decreased wind speed increased hypolimnion thickness while decreasing its temperature and DO consumption rate. Decreased TP loading improved DO conditions with a reduction of 75\% effectively abolishing hypoxia. Anoxia was more sensitive to air temperature, wind and nutrient changes than was hypoxia. New metrics that capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of low DO conditions were more sensitive than the commonly-cited maximum areas of hypoxia or anoxia. Over most of the relevant range of forcing factors, the simple and first order effect of a 1 °C temperature change was equivalent to a 10-14\% change in TP loads, while a 1\% change in wind speed was equivalent to a 2-3\% change in TP loads. Reduced ice cover in warmer climates will likely increase air temperature effects even further.},

	abstract = {Many lakes exhibit seasonal stratification, during which they develop strong thermal and chemical gradients. An expansion of depth-integrated monitoring programs has provided insight into the importance of organic carbon processing that occurs below the upper mixed layer. However, the chemical and physical drivers of metabolism and metabolic coupling remain unresolved, especially in the metalimnion. In this depth zone, sharp gradients in key resources such as light and temperature co-occur with dynamic physical conditions that influence metabolic processes directly and simultaneously hamper the accurate tracing of biological activity. We evaluated the drivers of metalimnetic metabolism and its associated uncertainty across 10 stratified lakes in Europe and North America. We hypothesized that the metalimnion would contribute highly to whole-lake functioning in clear oligotrophic lakes, and that metabolic rates would be highly variable in unstable polymictic lakes. Depth-integrated rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were modelled from diel dissolved oxygen curves using a Bayesian approach. Metabolic estimates were more uncertain below the epilimnion, but uncertainty was not consistently related to lake morphology or mixing regime. Metalimnetic rates exhibited high day-to-day variability in all trophic states, with the metalimnetic contribution to daily whole-lake GPP and ER ranging from 0\% to 87\% and {\textless} 1\% to 92\%, respectively. Nonetheless, the metalimnion of low-nutrient lakes contributed strongly to whole-lake metabolism on average, driven by a collinear combination of highlight, low surface-water phosphorous concentration and high metalimnetic volume. Consequently, a single-sensor approach does not necessarily reflect whole-ecosystem carbon dynamics in stratified lakes.},

	abstract = {H. T. Odum's influential Limnology and Oceanography 1956 publication compared gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) among aquatic ecosystems. Few syntheses of aquatic ecosystem metabolism have been completed since. We used Odum's conceptual framework to compare GPP and ER from open-water diel oxygen curves in lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and streams (n = 350). We also documented environmental drivers of metabolism among ecosystems. GPP and ER were strongly related in lakes and estuaries, but weakly related in streams and wetlands. GPP and ER were highest in estuaries, and GPP : ER was lowest in streams. Differences in the magnitude and variability of metabolism among ecosystems were attributable to landscape and water-column factors. Watershed size and phosphorus (P) concentrations were positively related to GPP and ER across all ecosystems. Considered independently, lake and estuary GPP were driven by P concentrations. In contrast, land-use and canopy cover drove stream metabolism, not nutrient concentrations. Results confirmed the classic paradigm that estuaries are the most productive aquatic ecosystem; however, our synthesis showed that relative to streams and estuaries, there was higher variation in lake GPP and ER than previously documented. Results will be valuable for management, restoration, and carbon budgets, which incorporate metabolism measurements at both the catchment and landscape scales. As metabolism datasets grow, future syntheses will address challenges including seasonality, sensor deployment time and location, hydrology, and variation in analytical conventions by discipline. Ongoing technological and computational advancements, combined with increased communication among subdisciplines, should also expand insights generated by subsequent metabolism syntheses.},

This balance took into account hydrological and biogeochemical processes affecting dissolved inorganic (DIC), dissolved organic (DOC) and particulate organic (POC) carbon species. Accumulation varied greatly on a seasonal and yearly basis. The lake exported carbon during most of the year except during spring floods and in late autumn. In-lake processes were responsible for exporting POC and storing DOC while DIC switched between storage and export. The carbon cycle was alternatively dominated in 2009 by biogeochemical processes and in 2011 by riverine fluxes, whereas in 2010 the two process types were of the same magnitude. These results suggest that the role of large shallow lakes like Võrtsjärv in the global C cycle is equally driven by hydrological factors, in particular seasonal water level changes, and by biogeochemical in-lake reactions.},

The central result of this article is a relation between time averaged GPP and the amplitude of the diel harmonic in an oxygen time series. We call this relation the Fourier method for estimating GPP. To assess the performance and accuracy of the method, we generate synthetic oxygen time series with a series of gradually more complex models, and compare the result with simulated GPP. We demonstrate that the method is applicable in systems with a range of rates of mixing, air–water exchange and primary production. We also apply the new method to oxygen time series from the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) and compare it with 14C-based GPP measurements. We demonstrate the Fourier method is particularly suited for estimating GPP in estuarine and coastal systems where tidal advection has a large imprint in observed oxygen concentrations. As such it enlarges the number of systems where GPP can be estimated from in situ oxygen concentrations. By shifting the focus to the frequency domain, we also gain some useful insights on the effect of observational error and of stochastic drivers of oxygen dynamics on metabolic estimates derived from oxygen time series.},

In order to assess spatial differences in metabolism estimates, the lake was divided into three geographical areas (North, Central, and South) and each area was subdivided into two biological zones (littoral and pelagic). A well-marked littoral to pelagic gradient was observed, with significant differences in the metabolism estimates between the biological zones of each compartment. In addition, a significant longitudinal difference in metabolism between the North and other lake areas was also apparent. Temporal dynamics featured continuous switching between net autotrophic and net heterotrophic conditions. Phytoplankton primary production and respiration were the main individual processes controlling gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, respectively, for the entire lake. Our findings indicated that spatially distributed estimates of lake metabolism led to different conclusions than did overall metabolism estimates based on single points. Also, individual processes must be taken into account in order to fully understand their relative importance on different spatial and temporal scales for the overall metabolism of aquatic ecosystems.},

We hypothesized that long-term averages of light-related variables would be better predictors of lake metabolism than nutrient-related variables. Model input parameters were in situ high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and irradiance. Model simulations were conducted for several (5–12) diel cycles for each lake during the summer season. Accounting for uncertainty, the results from the Bayesian model revealed that 2 lakes were autotrophic for the duration of the experiment, 1 was heterotrophic, and 5 were balanced or had an ambiguous metabolic state. Cross-comparison with a traditional bookkeeping model showed that the majority of lakes were in metabolic balance. A strong coupling between primary production and respiration was observed, with the share of autochthonous primary production respired by consumers increasing with light extinction and nutrient-related variables. Unlike gross primary production, community respiration was strongly related to light extinction, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus. These findings suggest that a drastic decrease in light-limited primary production along the DOC gradient counter-balanced nutrient supply in the darker lakes and thus blurred the relationship between primary production and nutrients. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, both light and nutrient-related variables seemed to be good predictors of lake respiration and its coupling to lake primary production.},

This was calibrated to high-resolution (15 min), long-term (2.5 years) dissolved oxygen (DO) time series for moorland and forest reaches of a third-order montane stream in Scotland. The model was multicriteria calibrated to continuous 24 h periods within the time series to identify behavioral simulations representative of ecosystem functioning. Results were evaluated using a seasonal regional sensitivity analysis and a colinearity index for parameter sensitivity. This showed that {\textgreater}95 \% of the behavioral models for the moorland and forest sites were identifiable and able to infer in-stream processes from the DO time series for around 40\% and 32\% of the time period, respectively. Monthly P/R ratios {\textless}1 indicate a heterotrophic system with both sites exhibiting similar temporal patterns; with a maximum in February and a second peak during summer months. However, the estimated net ecosystem productivity suggests that the moorland reach without riparian tree cover is likely to be a much larger source of carbon to the atmosphere (122 mmol C m−2 d−1) compared to the forested reach (64 mmol C m−2 d−1). We conclude that such process-based oxygen mass balance models may be transferable tools for investigating other systems; specifically, well-oxygenated upland channels with high hydraulic roughness and lacking reaeration measurements.},

	abstract = {Global changes, such as climate and land use alterations, are expected to affect freshwater ecosystems, modifying environmental conditions with ultimate effects on carbon and nutrient cycling. While effects of these changes have been the focus of several studies in temperate lakes, remarkably little effort has been dedicated to understanding the behaviour and responses of tropical lakes despite their importance in tropical environments. In a factorial mesocosm study conducted in a tropical lake, we investigated how changes in environmental conditions, such as additions of inorganic nutrients and allochthonous organic matter, and shading, affect gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (R) and net community production (NCP) rates, and the occurrence of GPP light saturation and photoinhibition. GPP rates in the mesocosms were enhanced by additions of inorganic nutrients (+NP) and organic matter (+C) and decreased with increasing mean light available (Ī). Apparent photoinhibition was pronounced in full light treatments (+L) without additions of nutrients (−NP) and organic matter (−C), occurring in 91\% of the experimental days. This supports previous evidence of the importance of photoinhibition in the upper mixed layer of the lake, especially during nutrient depletion and high light availability in the warmer rainy season. The main factor affecting metabolic rates was nutrients (NP), followed by organic matter (C). Effect of light (L) and the interaction between C and L were also significant for GPP and R rates. Addition of allochthonous organic matter (+C) with a high content of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) stimulated GPP rates and reduced the occurrence of apparent photoinhibition and light saturation. This also increased R rates in the mesocosms. However, R was strongly coupled to GPP, indicating that changes in respiration were more related to autotrophic activity than to a direct and independent stimulation of heterotrophic communities. Our results strongly support recent evidence of the interactions between nutrients, organic matter and light conditions, which under a scenario of changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation events and human-mediated changes in land use, may affect the magnitude, variability and balance of metabolic processes in the productive upper mixed layers of tropical lakes.},

	abstract = {Inverse modeling is a common practice to decompose observed processes into constituents that are unobservable or difficult to measure. To achieve this goal, a mechanistic model is calibrated to fit the observations and thereby the model produces a coherent set of constituent estimates. A disadvantage of this procedure is that any disagreement between the model assumptions and reality potentially introduces bias and other statistical artifacts into the constituents and their relations. Lake metabolism is recently most often followed by high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, and inverse modeling with simple conceptual models is used to couple oxygen dynamics to ecosystem-wide aggregated metabolic rates, such as net ecosystem production (NEP). These models rely on estimates of gas exchange and community respiration. Using a model of a simple ecosystem and field data, we demonstrate that typical relations between modeled metabolic rates frequently do not follow patterns expected from synthetic ecosystems and that estimation errors strongly influence calculations by producing strong, spurious correlations. Correlation artifacts can be expected during inverse modeling, whenever observed time series are decomposed into poorly known or unmeasured processes that can compensate for the effect of each other.},

	abstract = {Twenty-three station-years of diel oxygen data for the James River Estuary were analyzed to characterize longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual patterns of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We compared two commonly used methods for deriving metabolism (bookkeeping and Bayesian) to determine whether the observed patterns were robust with respect to computational methodology. The two methods revealed similar longitudinal patterns of increasing GPP and ER, and decreasing net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), with increasing salinity. Seasonal patterns in GPP and ER tracked water temperature and solar radiation, except during high discharge events when metabolism declined by 40\%. The bookkeeping method yielded higher estimates of GPP and ER in the higher end of the range, and smaller estimates in the low end of the range, thereby accentuating seasonal and longitudinal differences. Inferences regarding net autotrophy and heterotrophy were robust, as both methods yielded positive estimates of NEM at the chlorophyll maximum (tidal fresh segment) and negative values for the saline portion of the estuary. Inferences regarding the relative importance of allochthonous inputs (based on inferred ER at GPP = 0) differed between the two methods. Values derived by the bookkeeping method indicated that respiration was largely supported by autochthonous production, whereas the Bayesian results indicated that autochthonous and allochthonous inputs were equally important. Overall, our findings show that methodological differences were small in the context of longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual variation but that the bookkeeping method yielded a wider range of values for GPP and ER relative to the Bayesian estimates.},

	abstract = {Under-ice dissolved oxygen (DO) metabolism and DO depletion are poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict how changing winter conditions will affect lake ecosystems. We analyzed under-ice DO dynamics based on high-frequency (HF) data at two depths (5 and 25 m) for three winters (January–March 2014, 2015, and 2016) in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (1178 m above sea level; maximum depth 39 m). Specifically, we assessed diel metabolic rates based on HF data of DO, temperature, and light for winter 2016 and seasonal DO depletion rates based on HF data of DO for all three winters. For 2016, calculations of metabolic rates were possible only for 34\% and 3\% of days at 5 and 25 m, respectively; these metabolic rates generally indicated net heterotrophy at both depths. Low success in modeling metabolic rates was attributed to low diel DO variability and anomalous diel DO patterns, probably linked to under-ice physical processes. Seasonal DO patterns for the three winters showed increasing, decreasing, or stable DO trends at 5 m while at 25 m patterns always showed decreasing DO trends but with different rates. Our multiyear study permitted us to hypothesize that the observed intraannual and interannual differences in DO depletion can be attributed to variable snow cover determining the penetration of radiation and thus photosynthesis. This study brings new insights to DO dynamics in ice-covered systems, highlights the challenges linked to under-ice lake metabolism, and advocates for a modeling approach that includes physical processes.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem metabolism is an integrative measure of the production and respiration of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. However, under-ice regions and mixing periods are infrequently sampled because of logistical challenges and assumptions of low biological activity, resulting in limited understanding of the contribution of winter epilimnetic metabolism to annual carbon cycling. Aquatic ecosystems can emit up to 76\% of the carbon they receive from terrestrial landscapes as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, making them significant contributors to Earth’s carbon cycle. Consequently, studying metabolism under ice is especially important given that warmer winters have already shortened ice cover and lengthened ice transitional periods, potentially resulting in greater carbon dioxide emissions. Using a continuous year of epilimnetic high-frequency dissolved oxygen data, we found that gross primary production was low but not absent under ice and increased during the end of the under-ice period. Despite cold water temperatures, under-ice respiration was 1.2 times higher than summer respiration, and ice-on and ice-off periods were important contributors to annual metabolism estimates. On average, under-ice net ecosystem production (NEP) was negative, in contrast to positive NEP for the spring and summer periods. Including winter metabolism estimates flipped annual NEP from autotrophy to heterotrophy, demonstrating that year-round sampling is essential for accurately assessing carbon cycling in lakes.},

However, estimates of seasonal and interannual variability of whole-system estuarine NEP, which provide insight into how estuaries respond to climatic and anthropogenic forcing, are rare. The main objectives of this study are to (1) determine the seasonal and interannual variability in whole-system NEP of Biscayne Bay, a subtropical, shallow estuary located in southeastern Florida, USA, and (2) determine the potential driving mechanisms of NEP in this estuary. We compute monthly NEP over more than 12 years by constructing the dissolved oxygen budget for the estuary from monthly snapshot oxygen survey data (i.e., collected once per month). High-frequency observations of oxygen in similar subtropical estuaries were used to quantify the error associated with the snapshot monthly sampling. Oxygen air–water exchange and NEP closely balanced each other, with the long-term mean NEP (± 2 standard errors) equal to − 5.3 ± 0.3 mol O2 m−2 year−1, indicating net heterotrophy. Significant seasonality was found, with lowest NEP in September. At monthly time scales, NEP was significantly positively correlated with chlorophyll and total phosphorus and significantly negatively correlated with canal flow. Interannual variability in NEP was substantial, and the bay temporarily shifted from net heterotrophy to net autotrophy after the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, probably in response to increases in nutrients from runoff and resuspension. These findings show that monthly oxygen surveys can be used to quantify whole-system estuarine NEP and that Biscayne Bay NEP is sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic forcing on seasonal and interannual timescales.},

Ratios by their nature do not respond symmetrically to changes in the numerator and denominator and do not follow normal distributions; however, researchers frequently fail to consider these properties in their analyses, which has biased reported results. Calculating means, variance, or linear slopes based on untransformed ratios results in biased results. I demonstrate the consequences of these errors for inferences from stoichiometric analyses using simple examples and several large monitoring data sets. I then review 100 studies in ecological stoichiometry and find that misuse of ratio data is common, with 93\% of studies containing at least one error. These errors may be problematic, particularly in large-scale meta-analyses summarizing data over large ranges. Fortunately, most of these mistakes can be easily avoided by first log transforming elemental ratios. I therefore recommend that, to ensure robust and reproducible results, researchers in ecological stoichiometry should adopt a convention of presenting stoichiometric ratio data as the logarithm of molar ratios in the future. The widespread use of untransformed nitrogen to phosphorus ratio as an indicator of nutrient limitation has likely exaggerated the importance of phosphorus limitation, particularly in freshwater systems.},

We present a new approach to data-driven discovery of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs), in explicit or implicit form. We demonstrate our approach on a wide range of problems, including shallow water equations and Navier–Stokes equations. The key idea is to select candidate terms for the underlying equations using dimensional analysis, and to approximate the weights of the terms with error bars using our threshold sparse Bayesian regression. This new algorithm employs Bayesian inference to tune the hyperparameters automatically. Our approach is effective, robust and able to quantify uncertainties by providing an error bar for each discovered candidate equation. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through a collection of classical ODEs and PDEs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm with respect to noisy data and its ability to discover various candidate equations with error bars that represent the quantified uncertainties. Detailed comparisons with the sequential threshold least-squares algorithm and the lasso algorithm are studied from noisy time-series measurements and indicate that the proposed method provides more robust and accurate results. In addition, the data-driven prediction of dynamics with error bars using discovered governing physical laws is more accurate and robust than classical polynomial regressions.},

These ecosystem components not only change over time but also interact with each other. Therefore, investigation of individual relationships may give limited insights into their interdependencies and limit ability to predict future ecosystem states. We address this problem by analyzing long-term (16–39 years) time series data from 10 aquatic ecosystems and using convergent cross mapping (CCM) to quantify the causal networks linking phytoplankton species richness, biomass, and physicochemical factors. We determined that individual quantities (e.g., total species richness or nutrients) were not significant predictors of ecosystem stability (quantified as long-term fluctuation of phytoplankton biomass); rather, the integrated causal pathway in the ecosystem network, composed of the interactions among species richness, nutrient cycling, and phytoplankton biomass, was the best predictor of stability. Furthermore, systems that experienced stronger warming over time had both weakened causal interactions and larger fluctuations. Thus, rather than thinking in terms of separate factors, a more holistic network view, that causally links species richness and the other ecosystem components, is required to understand and predict climate impacts on the temporal stability of aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {An important approach for scientific inquiry across many disciplines involves using observational time series data to understand the relationships between key variables to gain mechanistic insights into the underlying rules that govern the given system. In real systems, such as those found in ecology, the relationships between time series variables are generally not static; instead, these relationships are dynamical and change in a nonlinear or state-dependent manner. To further understand such systems, we investigate integrating methods that appropriately characterize these dynamics (i.e., methods that measure interactions as they change with time-varying system states) with visualization techniques that can help analyze the behavior of the system. Here, we focus on empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a state-of-the-art method that specifically identifies causal variables and measures changing state-dependent relationships between time series variables. Instead of using approaches centered on parametric equations, EDM is an equation-free approach that studies systems based on their dynamic attractors. We propose a visual analytics system to support the identification and mechanistic interpretation of system states using an EDM-constructed dynamic graph. This work, as detailed in four analysis tasks and demonstrated with a GUI, provides a novel synthesis of EDM and visualization techniques such as brush-link visualization and visual summarization to interpret dynamic graphs representing ecosystem dynamics. We applied our proposed system to ecological simulation data and real data from a marine mesocosm study as two key use cases. Our case studies show that our visual analytics tools support the identification and interpretation of the system state by the user, and enable us to discover both confirmatory and new findings in ecosystem dynamics. Overall, we demonstrated that our system can facilitate an understanding of how systems function beyond the intuitive analysis of high-dimensional information based on specific domain knowledge.},

              Globally, lake surface water temperatures have warmed rapidly relative to air temperatures, but changes in deepwater temperatures and vertical thermal structure are still largely unknown. We have compiled the most comprehensive data set to date of long-term (1970–2009) summertime vertical temperature profiles in lakes across the world to examine trends and drivers of whole-lake vertical thermal structure. We found significant increases in surface water temperatures across lakes at an average rate of + 0.37 °C decade
              −1
              , comparable to changes reported previously for other lakes, and similarly consistent trends of increasing water column stability (+ 0.08 kg m
              −3
              decade
              −1
              ). In contrast, however, deepwater temperature trends showed little change on average (+ 0.06 °C decade
              −1
              ), but had high variability across lakes, with trends in individual lakes ranging from − 0.68 °C decade
              −1
              to + 0.65 °C decade
              −1
              . The variability in deepwater temperature trends was not explained by trends in either surface water temperatures or thermal stability within lakes, and only 8.4\% was explained by lake thermal region or local lake characteristics in a random forest analysis. These findings suggest that external drivers beyond our tested lake characteristics are important in explaining long-term trends in thermal structure, such as local to regional climate patterns or additional external anthropogenic influences.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the production and consumption of organic material have been a focus of aquatic science for more than 80 years. Over the last century, a variety of approaches have been developed and employed for measuring rates of gross primary production (Pg), respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (Pn = Pg − R) within aquatic ecosystems. Here, we reconsider the range of approaches and applications for ecosystem metabolism measurements, and suggest ways by which such studies can continue to contribute to aquatic ecology. This paper reviews past and contemporary studies of aquatic ecosystem-level metabolism to identify their role in understanding and managing aquatic systems. We identify four broad research objectives that have motivated ecosystem metabolism studies: (1) quantifying magnitude and variability of metabolic rates for cross-system comparison, (2) estimating organic matter transfer between adjacent systems or subsystems, (3) measuring ecosystem-scale responses to perturbation, both natural and anthropogenic, and (4) quantifying and calibrating models of biogeochemical processes and trophic networks. The magnitudes of whole-system gross primary production, respiration and net ecosystem production rates vary among aquatic environments and are partly constrained by the chosen methodology. We argue that measurements of ecosystem metabolism should be a vital component of routine monitoring at larger scales in the aquatic environment using existing flexible, precise, and durable sensor technologies. Current and future aquatic ecosystem studies will benefit from application of new methods for metabolism measurements, which facilitate integration of process measurements and calibration of models for addressing fundamental questions involving ecosystem-scale processes.},

Averaged over the deployment, aerial metabolism estimates among sensor locations varied 1–2 orders of magnitude and were largely unrelated to physical habitat within the lake. For all sites and days, 76–90\% of the explainable variance in GPP and R was attributable to location in the lake rather than day of the deployment. NEP, on the other hand, was less affected by location, with 79–93\% of the explained variance attributable to the day of the deployment. Single-location estimates can yield errors of more than an order of magnitude in estimates of daily GPP and R and can mischaracterize the trophic status of the lake. Using a rarefaction approach, we found that using four randomly placed sensors increased the precision of the resulting daily metabolism estimates fourfold over single-location measures in both lakes.},

	abstract = {Twenty-three station-years of diel oxygen data for the James River Estuary were analyzed to characterize longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual patterns of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We compared two commonly used methods for deriving metabolism (bookkeeping and Bayesian) to determine whether the observed patterns were robust with respect to computational methodology. The two methods revealed similar longitudinal patterns of increasing GPP and ER, and decreasing net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), with increasing salinity. Seasonal patterns in GPP and ER tracked water temperature and solar radiation, except during high discharge events when metabolism declined by 40\%. The bookkeeping method yielded higher estimates of GPP and ER in the higher end of the range, and smaller estimates in the low end of the range, thereby accentuating seasonal and longitudinal differences. Inferences regarding net autotrophy and heterotrophy were robust, as both methods yielded positive estimates of NEM at the chlorophyll maximum (tidal fresh segment) and negative values for the saline portion of the estuary. Inferences regarding the relative importance of allochthonous inputs (based on inferred ER at GPP = 0) differed between the two methods. Values derived by the bookkeeping method indicated that respiration was largely supported by autochthonous production, whereas the Bayesian results indicated that autochthonous and allochthonous inputs were equally important. Overall, our findings show that methodological differences were small in the context of longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual variation but that the bookkeeping method yielded a wider range of values for GPP and ER relative to the Bayesian estimates.},

Few syntheses of aquatic ecosystem metabolism have been completed since. We used Odum's conceptual framework to compare GPP and ER from open-water diel oxygen curves in lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and streams (n = 350). We also documented environmental drivers of metabolism among ecosystems. GPP and ER were strongly related in lakes and estuaries, but weakly related in streams and wetlands. GPP and ER were highest in estuaries, and GPP : ER was lowest in streams. Differences in the magnitude and variability of metabolism among ecosystems were attributable to landscape and water-column factors. Watershed size and phosphorus (P) concentrations were positively related to GPP and ER across all ecosystems. Considered independently, lake and estuary GPP were driven by P concentrations. In contrast, land-use and canopy cover drove stream metabolism, not nutrient concentrations. Results confirmed the classic paradigm that estuaries are the most productive aquatic ecosystem; however, our synthesis showed that relative to streams and estuaries, there was higher variation in lake GPP and ER than previously documented. Results will be valuable for management, restoration, and carbon budgets, which incorporate metabolism measurements at both the catchment and landscape scales. As metabolism datasets grow, future syntheses will address challenges including seasonality, sensor deployment time and location, hydrology, and variation in analytical conventions by discipline. Ongoing technological and computational advancements, combined with increased communication among subdisciplines, should also expand insights generated by subsequent metabolism syntheses.},

Parallel increases in concentration across the seven lakes during drought were attributable to evapoconcentration. However, we observed divergent trends for mass, which better reflects altered solute flux by accounting for changes in lake volume. Ca+Mg mass increased in three groundwater-dominated lakes as precipitation inputs were low and groundwater discharging from longer flowpaths became proportionately more important. In contrast, decreases in Ca+Mg mass for two precipitation-dominated lakes reflected diminished inputs of solute-rich groundwater. Landscape position, defined by the spatial position of a lake within a hydrologic flow system, accounted for the divergence in chemical responses to drought.},

We fit Bayesian hierarchical models to thousands of observations from over two decades to quantify four components of variation – spatial (local and regional) and temporal (local and coherent); and to model their drivers. We found strong support for three propositions: (1) spatial variation at local and regional scales are large and roughly equal, (2) annual temporal variation is mostly local rather than coherent, and, (3) spatial variation exceeds temporal variation. Our findings imply that predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes at macroscales requires consideration of the dominant spatial signals at both local and regional scales that may overwhelm temporal signals.},

	abstract = {We quantify the allochthonous organic carbon (OC) budgets for seven north temperate lakes, using diverse information about their land cover, hydrology, and limnological characteristics. We develop a simple equilibrium model within a Bayesian framework that exploits the differences among the lakes to estimate three key rates: aerial loading (AOC) and wetland loading (WOC) from adjacent ecosystems and whole-lake mineralization of OC (RDOC). Combined with observational data, these rates allow for estimates of the total OC loads, mineralization, and sedimentation within lakes and export to downstream ecosystems. AOC was 1.15 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, WOC ranged from 0.72 to 3.00 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, and RDOC, normalized to 20°C, ranged from 0.00083 to 0.0015 d−1. Total loads ranged from about 5 to 55 g C m−2 yr−1. Ecosystems immediately adjacent to lakes accounted for one-half or more of total OC loads for some lakes. Whether a lake processed and stored more allochthonous OC than it exported depended primarily on hydrologic residence time. Our equilibrium model provides a parsimonious approach to quantifying allochthonous OC budgets in lakes with relatively minimal baseline data.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 °C during the test period (DL: 1.78 °C, PB: 2.03 °C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.},

	abstract = {The Livingstone and Imboden (1996) model for the oxygen depletion rate in lake hypolimnia was evaluated with field results in 32 lakes. The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

In order to assess spatial differences in metabolism estimates, the lake was divided into three geographical areas (North, Central, and South) and each area was subdivided into two biological zones (littoral and pelagic). A well-marked littoral to pelagic gradient was observed, with significant differences in the metabolism estimates between the biological zones of each compartment. In addition, a significant longitudinal difference in metabolism between the North and other lake areas was also apparent. Temporal dynamics featured continuous switching between net autotrophic and net heterotrophic conditions. Phytoplankton primary production and respiration were the main individual processes controlling gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, respectively, for the entire lake. Our findings indicated that spatially distributed estimates of lake metabolism led to different conclusions than did overall metabolism estimates based on single points. Also, individual processes must be taken into account in order to fully understand their relative importance on different spatial and temporal scales for the overall metabolism of aquatic ecosystems.},

Conversely, the observed curves of oxygen in streams can be used to calculate the component rates of production, respiration, and diffusion. New production values obtained with these analyses of oxygen curves from various sources, as well as a few previously existing estimates of primary production, indicate a generally higher rate of production in flowing waters than in other types of aquatic environments. The ratio of total primary production to total community respiration is used to classify communities quantitatively according to their predominantly heterotrophic or autotrophic characteristics. Longitudinal succession within a stream tends to modify the ratio towards unity from higher values for autotrophic and from lower values for heterotrophic communities. The behavior of this ratio is described for the annual cycle in a stream, for the sequence of pollution recovery, and for diverse types of communities.},

	abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

This was calibrated to high-resolution (15 min), long-term (2.5 years) dissolved oxygen (DO) time series for moorland and forest reaches of a third-order montane stream in Scotland. The model was multicriteria calibrated to continuous 24 h periods within the time series to identify behavioral simulations representative of ecosystem functioning. Results were evaluated using a seasonal regional sensitivity analysis and a colinearity index for parameter sensitivity. This showed that {\textgreater}95 \% of the behavioral models for the moorland and forest sites were identifiable and able to infer in-stream processes from the DO time series for around 40\% and 32\% of the time period, respectively. Monthly P/R ratios {\textless}1 indicate a heterotrophic system with both sites exhibiting similar temporal patterns; with a maximum in February and a second peak during summer months. However, the estimated net ecosystem productivity suggests that the moorland reach without riparian tree cover is likely to be a much larger source of carbon to the atmosphere (122 mmol C m−2 d−1) compared to the forested reach (64 mmol C m−2 d−1). We conclude that such process-based oxygen mass balance models may be transferable tools for investigating other systems; specifically, well-oxygenated upland channels with high hydraulic roughness and lacking reaeration measurements.},

Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

All lakes underwent an abrupt increase in VWHO and mean hypolimnetic DO after 2010. In four of the six study lakes, the highest hypolimnetic DO concentrations were observed in years where chlorophyll a concentrations were low, whereas at ﬁve of the six study lakes the highest hypolimnetic volumes were observed when dissolved organic carbon concentrations were relatively high. Warmer spring or winter air temperatures were associated with higher hypolimnetic DO concentrations at two sites, and longer ice-free periods were associated with smaller hypolimnetic volumes at two sites. These results suggest that the recent VWHO increases in the studied south-central Ontario lakes may be a function of multiple drivers that include changes in primary production, lake water transparency, and regional climatic factors.},

	abstract = {Recent literature has suggested that for many lakes and rivers, the respiratory breakdown of organic matter (R) exceeds production of organic matter by photosynthesis (gross primary production [GPP]) within the water body. This metabolic balance (GPP {\textgreater} R; “heterotrophy”) implies that allochthonous organic matter supports a portion of the aquatic ecosystem's respiration. Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of lake types studied, especially with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are two reasons for differing conclusions. We deployed O2 and CO2 sondes to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 lakes. From these data, we calculated GPP, R, and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP − R). Over the broad range in TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O2 changed on a near 1 : 1 molar ratio. Metabolism estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set had negative NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were nearly equal, but, at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had negative NEP. Strong correlations between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon influences lake metabolism.},

	abstract = {The development of complete regional carbon (C) budgets for different biomes is an integral step in the effort to predict global response and potential feedbacks to a changing climate regime. Wetland and lake contributions to regional C cycling remain relatively uncertain despite recent research highlighting their importance. Using a combination of field surveys and tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, modeling, and published literature, we constructed a complete C budget for the Northern Highlands Lake District in northern Wisconsin/Michigan, a ∼6400 km2 region rich in lakes and wetlands. This is one of the first regional C budgets to incorporate aquatic and terrestrial C cycling under the same framework. We divided the landscape into three major compartments (forests, wetlands, and surface waters) and quantified all major C fluxes into and out of those compartments, with a particular focus on atmospheric exchange but also including sedimentation in lakes and hydrologic fluxes. Landscape C storage was dominated by peat-containing wetlands and lake sediments, which make up only 20\% and 13\% of the landscape area, respectively, but contain {\textgreater}80\% of the total fixed C pool (ca. 400 Tg). We estimated a current regional C accumulation of 1.1±0.1 Tg yr−1, and the largest regional flux was forest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into aggrading forests for a total of 1.0±0.1 Tg yr−1. Mean wetland NEE (0.12±0.06 Tg yr−1 into wetlands), lake CO2 emissions and riverine efflux (each ca. 0.03±0.01 Tg yr−1) were smaller but of consequence to the overall budget. Hydrologic transport from uplands/wetlands to surface waters within the region was an important vector of terrestrial C. Regional C fluxes and pools would be misrepresented without inclusion of surface waters and wetlands, and C budgets in heterogeneous landscapes open opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important fluxes to changes in climate and land use/land cover.},

	abstract = {Global changes, such as climate and land use alterations, are expected to affect freshwater ecosystems, modifying environmental conditions with ultimate effects on carbon and nutrient cycling. While effects of these changes have been the focus of several studies in temperate lakes, remarkably little effort has been dedicated to understanding the behaviour and responses of tropical lakes despite their importance in tropical environments. In a factorial mesocosm study conducted in a tropical lake, we investigated how changes in environmental conditions, such as additions of inorganic nutrients and allochthonous organic matter, and shading, affect gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (R) and net community production (NCP) rates, and the occurrence of GPP light saturation and photoinhibition. GPP rates in the mesocosms were enhanced by additions of inorganic nutrients (+NP) and organic matter (+C) and decreased with increasing mean light available (Ī). Apparent photoinhibition was pronounced in full light treatments (+L) without additions of nutrients (−NP) and organic matter (−C), occurring in 91\% of the experimental days. This supports previous evidence of the importance of photoinhibition in the upper mixed layer of the lake, especially during nutrient depletion and high light availability in the warmer rainy season. The main factor affecting metabolic rates was nutrients (NP), followed by organic matter (C). Effect of light (L) and the interaction between C and L were also significant for GPP and R rates. Addition of allochthonous organic matter (+C) with a high content of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) stimulated GPP rates and reduced the occurrence of apparent photoinhibition and light saturation. This also increased R rates in the mesocosms. However, R was strongly coupled to GPP, indicating that changes in respiration were more related to autotrophic activity than to a direct and independent stimulation of heterotrophic communities. Our results strongly support recent evidence of the interactions between nutrients, organic matter and light conditions, which under a scenario of changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation events and human-mediated changes in land use, may affect the magnitude, variability and balance of metabolic processes in the productive upper mixed layers of tropical lakes.},

The models used to estimate metabolism often subsume biological processes into one parameter each for GPP and R. However, high-frequency DO observations made over days show diverse patterns at multiple time scales, suggesting a complex suite of processes controls DO dynamics. Can we improve metabolism estimates and predictive ability for DO at diel scales by adding complexity to the models? In this study, we use data from two north temperate lakes to test a variety of metabolism models representing a suite of non-linear metabolic processes. To test whether alternative models can be discriminated, we simulated DO with assumed parameter values and auto-regressive noise, and fit the models to the simulated DO. The most complex model could be discriminated from simpler models and provided the most accurate and precise predictions. However, when models were fit to observed DO data from the sensor network, the simplest model predicted DO as well as the most complex one. The added complexity did not improve model performance. An analysis of the model residuals indicates that physics may explain some of the DO pattern not predicted, especially high-frequency oscillations and anomalies that appear to coincide with weather patterns. Under reasonably stable weather conditions and at scales of a few days, simple metabolism models explain the bulk of diel DO variability.},

The central result of this article is a relation between time averaged GPP and the amplitude of the diel harmonic in an oxygen time series. We call this relation the Fourier method for estimating GPP. To assess the performance and accuracy of the method, we generate synthetic oxygen time series with a series of gradually more complex models, and compare the result with simulated GPP. We demonstrate that the method is applicable in systems with a range of rates of mixing, air–water exchange and primary production. We also apply the new method to oxygen time series from the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) and compare it with 14C-based GPP measurements. We demonstrate the Fourier method is particularly suited for estimating GPP in estuarine and coastal systems where tidal advection has a large imprint in observed oxygen concentrations. As such it enlarges the number of systems where GPP can be estimated from in situ oxygen concentrations. By shifting the focus to the frequency domain, we also gain some useful insights on the effect of observational error and of stochastic drivers of oxygen dynamics on metabolic estimates derived from oxygen time series.},

	abstract = {Inverse modeling is a common practice to decompose observed processes into constituents that are unobservable or difficult to measure. To achieve this goal, a mechanistic model is calibrated to fit the observations and thereby the model produces a coherent set of constituent estimates. A disadvantage of this procedure is that any disagreement between the model assumptions and reality potentially introduces bias and other statistical artifacts into the constituents and their relations. Lake metabolism is recently most often followed by high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, and inverse modeling with simple conceptual models is used to couple oxygen dynamics to ecosystem-wide aggregated metabolic rates, such as net ecosystem production (NEP). These models rely on estimates of gas exchange and community respiration. Using a model of a simple ecosystem and field data, we demonstrate that typical relations between modeled metabolic rates frequently do not follow patterns expected from synthetic ecosystems and that estimation errors strongly influence calculations by producing strong, spurious correlations. Correlation artifacts can be expected during inverse modeling, whenever observed time series are decomposed into poorly known or unmeasured processes that can compensate for the effect of each other.},

We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) for up to a full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0.1 to 5.0 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5\% to 85\% of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Background respiration ranged from 0.017 to 2.1 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and was positively related to indicators of recalcitrant allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter loads, but was not clearly related to an indicator of the quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs.},

We analyzed under-ice DO dynamics based on high-frequency (HF) data at two depths (5 and 25 m) for three winters (January–March 2014, 2015, and 2016) in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (1178 m above sea level; maximum depth 39 m). Specifically, we assessed diel metabolic rates based on HF data of DO, temperature, and light for winter 2016 and seasonal DO depletion rates based on HF data of DO for all three winters. For 2016, calculations of metabolic rates were possible only for 34\% and 3\% of days at 5 and 25 m, respectively; these metabolic rates generally indicated net heterotrophy at both depths. Low success in modeling metabolic rates was attributed to low diel DO variability and anomalous diel DO patterns, probably linked to under-ice physical processes. Seasonal DO patterns for the three winters showed increasing, decreasing, or stable DO trends at 5 m while at 25 m patterns always showed decreasing DO trends but with different rates. Our multiyear study permitted us to hypothesize that the observed intraannual and interannual differences in DO depletion can be attributed to variable snow cover determining the penetration of radiation and thus photosynthesis. This study brings new insights to DO dynamics in ice-covered systems, highlights the challenges linked to under-ice lake metabolism, and advocates for a modeling approach that includes physical processes.},

Accumulation varied greatly on a seasonal and yearly basis. The lake exported carbon during most of the year except during spring floods and in late autumn. In-lake processes were responsible for exporting POC and storing DOC while DIC switched between storage and export. The carbon cycle was alternatively dominated in 2009 by biogeochemical processes and in 2011 by riverine fluxes, whereas in 2010 the two process types were of the same magnitude. These results suggest that the role of large shallow lakes like Võrtsjärv in the global C cycle is equally driven by hydrological factors, in particular seasonal water level changes, and by biogeochemical in-lake reactions.},

	abstract = {Many lakes exhibit seasonal stratification, during which they develop strong thermal and chemical gradients. An expansion of depth-integrated monitoring programs has provided insight into the importance of organic carbon processing that occurs below the upper mixed layer. However, the chemical and physical drivers of metabolism and metabolic coupling remain unresolved, especially in the metalimnion. In this depth zone, sharp gradients in key resources such as light and temperature co-occur with dynamic physical conditions that influence metabolic processes directly and simultaneously hamper the accurate tracing of biological activity. We evaluated the drivers of metalimnetic metabolism and its associated uncertainty across 10 stratified lakes in Europe and North America. We hypothesized that the metalimnion would contribute highly to whole-lake functioning in clear oligotrophic lakes, and that metabolic rates would be highly variable in unstable polymictic lakes. Depth-integrated rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were modelled from diel dissolved oxygen curves using a Bayesian approach. Metabolic estimates were more uncertain below the epilimnion, but uncertainty was not consistently related to lake morphology or mixing regime. Metalimnetic rates exhibited high day-to-day variability in all trophic states, with the metalimnetic contribution to daily whole-lake GPP and ER ranging from 0\% to 87\% and {\textless} 1\% to 92\%, respectively. Nonetheless, the metalimnion of low-nutrient lakes contributed strongly to whole-lake metabolism on average, driven by a collinear combination of highlight, low surface-water phosphorous concentration and high metalimnetic volume. Consequently, a single-sensor approach does not necessarily reflect whole-ecosystem carbon dynamics in stratified lakes.},

Therefore, we examined lake-atmosphere carbon fluxes with the goal of quantifying annual trends and patterns in lake carbon efflux and identifying important timescales. To do so, this study integrated 6 yr of eddy-covariance flux tower observations of lake-atmosphere fluxes with high-frequency observations of in-lake temperature, dissolved oxygen, and partial pressure of CO2, for a eutrophic lake in Wisconsin, U.S.A. While growing season fluxes are variable and switch between source and sink, annual net carbon fluxes show the lake acts as an annual sink of carbon, with the magnitude depending on climate, along with the timing and strength of fall turnover, with half of the total annual carbon uptake happening in October and November.},

	abstract = {We employed a Bayesian model to assess the metabolic state of 8 Estonian lakes representing the 8 lake types according to the European Union Water Framework Directive. We hypothesized that long-term averages of light-related variables would be better predictors of lake metabolism than nutrient-related variables. Model input parameters were in situ high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and irradiance. Model simulations were conducted for several (5–12) diel cycles for each lake during the summer season. Accounting for uncertainty, the results from the Bayesian model revealed that 2 lakes were autotrophic for the duration of the experiment, 1 was heterotrophic, and 5 were balanced or had an ambiguous metabolic state. Cross-comparison with a traditional bookkeeping model showed that the majority of lakes were in metabolic balance. A strong coupling between primary production and respiration was observed, with the share of autochthonous primary production respired by consumers increasing with light extinction and nutrient-related variables. Unlike gross primary production, community respiration was strongly related to light extinction, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus. These findings suggest that a drastic decrease in light-limited primary production along the DOC gradient counter-balanced nutrient supply in the darker lakes and thus blurred the relationship between primary production and nutrients. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, both light and nutrient-related variables seemed to be good predictors of lake respiration and its coupling to lake primary production.},

Averaged over the deployment, aerial metabolism estimates among sensor locations varied 1–2 orders of magnitude and were largely unrelated to physical habitat within the lake. For all sites and days, 76–90\% of the explainable variance in GPP and R was attributable to location in the lake rather than day of the deployment. NEP, on the other hand, was less affected by location, with 79–93\% of the explained variance attributable to the day of the deployment. Single-location estimates can yield errors of more than an order of magnitude in estimates of daily GPP and R and can mischaracterize the trophic status of the lake. Using a rarefaction approach, we found that using four randomly placed sensors increased the precision of the resulting daily metabolism estimates fourfold over single-location measures in both lakes.},

We fit Bayesian hierarchical models to thousands of observations from over two decades to quantify four components of variation – spatial (local and regional) and temporal (local and coherent); and to model their drivers. We found strong support for three propositions: (1) spatial variation at local and regional scales are large and roughly equal, (2) annual temporal variation is mostly local rather than coherent, and, (3) spatial variation exceeds temporal variation. Our findings imply that predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes at macroscales requires consideration of the dominant spatial signals at both local and regional scales that may overwhelm temporal signals.},

The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

We develop a simple equilibrium model within a Bayesian framework that exploits the differences among the lakes to estimate three key rates: aerial loading (AOC) and wetland loading (WOC) from adjacent ecosystems and whole-lake mineralization of OC (RDOC). Combined with observational data, these rates allow for estimates of the total OC loads, mineralization, and sedimentation within lakes and export to downstream ecosystems. AOC was 1.15 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, WOC ranged from 0.72 to 3.00 g C m−1 (shoreline) d−1, and RDOC, normalized to 20°C, ranged from 0.00083 to 0.0015 d−1. Total loads ranged from about 5 to 55 g C m−2 yr−1. Ecosystems immediately adjacent to lakes accounted for one-half or more of total OC loads for some lakes. Whether a lake processed and stored more allochthonous OC than it exported depended primarily on hydrologic residence time. Our equilibrium model provides a parsimonious approach to quantifying allochthonous OC budgets in lakes with relatively minimal baseline data.},

	abstract = {The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

	abstract = {Recent literature has suggested that for many lakes and rivers, the respiratory breakdown of organic matter (R) exceeds production of organic matter by photosynthesis (gross primary production [GPP]) within the water body. This metabolic balance (GPP {\textgreater} R; “heterotrophy”) implies that allochthonous organic matter supports a portion of the aquatic ecosystem's respiration. Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of lake types studied, especially with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are two reasons for differing conclusions. We deployed O2 and CO2 sondes to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 lakes. From these data, we calculated GPP, R, and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP − R). Over the broad range in TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O2 changed on a near 1 : 1 molar ratio. Metabolism estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set had negative NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were nearly equal, but, at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had negative NEP. Strong correlations between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon influences lake metabolism.},

	abstract = {Free-water measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) in lakes are becoming common and provide opportunities for estimating ecosystem processes, such as gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R). The models used to estimate metabolism often subsume biological processes into one parameter each for GPP and R. However, high-frequency DO observations made over days show diverse patterns at multiple time scales, suggesting a complex suite of processes controls DO dynamics. Can we improve metabolism estimates and predictive ability for DO at diel scales by adding complexity to the models? In this study, we use data from two north temperate lakes to test a variety of metabolism models representing a suite of non-linear metabolic processes. To test whether alternative models can be discriminated, we simulated DO with assumed parameter values and auto-regressive noise, and fit the models to the simulated DO. The most complex model could be discriminated from simpler models and provided the most accurate and precise predictions. However, when models were fit to observed DO data from the sensor network, the simplest model predicted DO as well as the most complex one. The added complexity did not improve model performance. An analysis of the model residuals indicates that physics may explain some of the DO pattern not predicted, especially high-frequency oscillations and anomalies that appear to coincide with weather patterns. Under reasonably stable weather conditions and at scales of a few days, simple metabolism models explain the bulk of diel DO variability.},

	abstract = {The development of complete regional carbon (C) budgets for different biomes is an integral step in the effort to predict global response and potential feedbacks to a changing climate regime. Wetland and lake contributions to regional C cycling remain relatively uncertain despite recent research highlighting their importance. Using a combination of field surveys and tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, modeling, and published literature, we constructed a complete C budget for the Northern Highlands Lake District in northern Wisconsin/Michigan, a ∼6400 km2 region rich in lakes and wetlands. This is one of the first regional C budgets to incorporate aquatic and terrestrial C cycling under the same framework. We divided the landscape into three major compartments (forests, wetlands, and surface waters) and quantified all major C fluxes into and out of those compartments, with a particular focus on atmospheric exchange but also including sedimentation in lakes and hydrologic fluxes. Landscape C storage was dominated by peat-containing wetlands and lake sediments, which make up only 20\% and 13\% of the landscape area, respectively, but contain {\textgreater}80\% of the total fixed C pool (ca. 400 Tg). We estimated a current regional C accumulation of 1.1±0.1 Tg yr−1, and the largest regional flux was forest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into aggrading forests for a total of 1.0±0.1 Tg yr−1. Mean wetland NEE (0.12±0.06 Tg yr−1 into wetlands), lake CO2 emissions and riverine efflux (each ca. 0.03±0.01 Tg yr−1) were smaller but of consequence to the overall budget. Hydrologic transport from uplands/wetlands to surface waters within the region was an important vector of terrestrial C. Regional C fluxes and pools would be misrepresented without inclusion of surface waters and wetlands, and C budgets in heterogeneous landscapes open opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important fluxes to changes in climate and land use/land cover.},

We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) for up to a full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0.1 to 5.0 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5\% to 85\% of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Background respiration ranged from 0.017 to 2.1 mg O2 L−1 d−1 and was positively related to indicators of recalcitrant allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter loads, but was not clearly related to an indicator of the quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs.},

This study used high-frequency data from 15 lakes provided by the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) to study how model choice of k influenced estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere. We tested 6 models of k on lakes chosen to span broad gradients in surface area and trophic states; a metabolism model was then fit to all 6 outputs of k data. We found that hourly values for k were substantially different between models and, at an annual scale, resulted in significantly different estimates of lake metabolism and gas exchange with the atmosphere.},

To do so, this study integrated 6 yr of eddy-covariance flux tower observations of lake-atmosphere fluxes with high-frequency observations of in-lake temperature, dissolved oxygen, and partial pressure of CO2, for a eutrophic lake in Wisconsin, U.S.A. While growing season fluxes are variable and switch between source and sink, annual net carbon fluxes show the lake acts as an annual sink of carbon, with the magnitude depending on climate, along with the timing and strength of fall turnover, with half of the total annual carbon uptake happening in October and November.},

They undergo seasonal changes resulting in an array of temperature and oxygen conditions; oxic-low, oxic-high, anoxic-low, and anoxic-high temperature. We sought to understand the interaction of temperature and oxygen conditions on benthic solutes exchange through a two-factorial sediment core incubation experiment by varying either temperature or oxygen conditions of sediment cores from an oligotrophic and eutrophic reservoir. Temperature and oxygen conditions are both important for nutrient release; however, they influence solutes differently; differences in the fluxes of the treatments were explained more by temperature for P, DOC and N, while for Fe, Mn and SO42−, differences were explained more by oxygen conditions. The combination of strongly reducing conditions (due to anoxia) and high temperature (20 °C) led to a significant increase in nutrients concentrations in the overlying water. Under these conditions, SRP flux was 0.04 and 0.5 mmol m−2 d−1; ammonium was 0.9 and 5.6 mmol m−2 d−1 for the oligotrophic and eutrophic reservoir, respectively. We observed a synergistic interaction between temperature and oxygen conditions which resulted in release of solutes from sediments. An increase in nutrients release under increasing temperatures is more likely and so are algal blooms.},

P inputs included fertilizer for agricultural crops and lawns, dietary supplements for dairy cattle, and natural inputs such as dry and wet deposition. Outputs included agricultural crops, livestock and livestock products, and hydrologic export to Lake Mendota. The total P input to the watershed (1,307,000 kg year−1) and total output (732,000 kg year−1) are large relative to the average of 34,000 kg P washing into the lake each year, indicating that the P flux that eutrophies Lake Mendota is a veryminor component of the total watershed P budget. Using the formula inputs−outputs = change in storage, we found that 575,000 kg P accumulated in the watershed in 1995. This estimate was corroborated by long-term soil P concentration data, which showed an average annual increase in soil P of over 450,000 kg year−1. Future management programs designed to reduce P inputs to Lake Mendota will be compelled to cope with the large amount of P being stored in the watershed.},

Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

	abstract = {How to model a pair of sentences is a critical issue in many NLP tasks such as answer selection (AS), paraphrase identification (PI) and textual entailment (TE). Most prior work (i) deals with one individual task by fine-tuning a specific system; (ii) models each sentence’s representation separately, rarely considering the impact of the other sentence; or (iii) relies fully on manually designed, task-specific linguistic features. This work presents a general Attention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a pair of sentences. We make three contributions. (i) The ABCNN can be applied to a wide variety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs. (ii) We propose three attention schemes that integrate mutual influence between sentences into CNNs; thus, the representation of each sentence takes into consideration its counterpart. These interdependent sentence pair representations are more powerful than isolated sentence representations. (iii) ABCNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on AS, PI and TE tasks.

	abstract = {Having insight into the causal associations in a complex system facilitates decision making, e.g., for medical treatments, urban infrastructure improvements or financial investments. The amount of observational data grows, which enables the discovery of causal relationships between variables from observation of their behaviour in time. Existing methods for causal discovery from time series data do not yet exploit the representational power of deep learning. We therefore present the Temporal Causal Discovery Framework (TCDF), a deep learning framework that learns a causal graph structure by discovering causal relationships in observational time series data. TCDF uses attention-based convolutional neural networks combined with a causal validation step. By interpreting the internal parameters of the convolutional networks, TCDF can also discover the time delay between a cause and the occurrence of its effect. Our framework learns temporal causal graphs, which can include confounders and instantaneous effects. Experiments on financial and neuroscientific benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance of TCDF on discovering causal relationships in continuous time series data. Furthermore, we show that TCDF can circumstantially discover the presence of hidden confounders. Our broadly applicable framework can be used to gain novel insights into the causal dependencies in a complex system, which is important for reliable predictions, knowledge discovery and data-driven decision making.},

              2
              pool due to its large size, it does play an important role in freshwater and marine nitrogen (N) cycling. N-fixation converts N
              2
              to ammonia, which can be used by microbes and phytoplankton, while denitrification/anammox effectively removes it by converting oxidized, inorganic N to N

              . We examined N
              2
              saturation to infer net biological nitrogen processes in 34 lakes across 5° latitude varying in trophic status, mixing regime, and bathymetry. Here, we report that nearly all lakes examined in the upper Midwest (USA) were supersaturated with N

              n

The traditional paradigm is that freshwaters compensate for N-limitation through N-fixation, but these results indicate that lakes were constantly losing N to the atmosphere via denitrification and/or anammox, suggesting that terrestrial N inputs are needed to balance the internal N cycle.},

	abstract = {Deep-learning techniques appear to be poised to play very important roles in our processing flows for inversion and interpretation of seismic data. The most successful seismic applications of these complex pattern-identifying networks will, presumably, be those that also leverage the deterministic physical models on which we normally base our seismic interpretations. If this is true, algorithms belonging to theory-guided data science, whose aim is roughly this, will have particular applicability in our field. We have developed a theory-designed recurrent neural network (RNN) that allows single- and multidimensional scalar acoustic seismic forward-modeling problems to be set up in terms of its forward propagation. We find that training such a network and updating its weights using measured seismic data then amounts to a solution of the seismic inverse problem and is equivalent to gradient-based seismic full-waveform inversion (FWI). By refining these RNNs in terms of optimization method and learning rate, comparisons are made between standard deep-learning optimization and nonlinear conjugate gradient and limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimized algorithms. Our numerical analysis indicates that adaptive moment (or Adam) optimization with a learning rate set to match the magnitudes of standard FWI updates appears to produce the most stable and well-behaved waveform inversion results, which is reconfirmed by a multidimensional 2D Marmousi experiment. Future waveform RNNs, with additional degrees of freedom, may allow optimal wave propagation rules to be solved for at the same time as medium properties, reducing modeling errors.},

	abstract = {Enhanced phosphorus (P) export from land into streams and lakes is a primary factor driving the expansion of deep-water hypoxia in lakes during the Anthropocene. However, the interplay of regional scale environmental stressors and the lack of long-term instrumental data often impede analyses attempting to associate changes in land cover with downstream aquatic responses. Herein, we performed a synthesis of data that link paleolimnological reconstructions of lake bottom-water oxygenation to changes in land cover/use and climate over the past 300 years to evaluate whether the spread of hypoxia in European lakes was primarily associated with enhanced P exports from growing urbanization, intensified agriculture, or climatic change. We showed that hypoxia started spreading in European lakes around CE 1850 and was greatly accelerated after CE 1900. Socioeconomic changes in Europe beginning in CE 1850 resulted in widespread urbanization, as well as a larger and more intensively cultivated surface area. However, our analysis of temporal trends demonstrated that the onset and intensification of lacustrine hypoxia were more strongly related to the growth of urban areas than to changes in agricultural areas and the application of fertilizers. These results suggest that anthropogenically triggered hypoxia in European lakes was primarily caused by enhanced P discharges from urban point sources. To date, there have been no signs of sustained recovery of bottom-water oxygenation in lakes following the enactment of European water legislation in the 1970s to 1980s, and the subsequent decrease in domestic P consumption.},

              hypoxia
              , for a specific level of oxygen depletion, can be expressed as the hypoxic factor in lakes, reservoirs, and river sections. These methods summarize information of individual dissolved oxygen profiles as annual values or factors that facilitate comparison between and within lakes. Therefore, these factors are useful in the formulation and testing of hypotheses related to the dissolved oxygen status in water bodies. Methods of calculating different factors for different oxygen levels and water layers, including those applying separately to the epilimnion and hypolimnion, are presented in detail. Proven and potential applicability include: (1) the quantification of relationships with lake water quality variables and lake classification (trophic state), (2) the evaluation of restoration techniques with respect to their effects on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, (3) the determination of internal phosphorus loading in stratified and polymictic lakes, (4) the exploration of habitat constraints due to hypoxia (e.g., fish species richness and winterkill), (5) forecasting potential effects of climatic change on oxygen content and internal phosphorus loading, and (6) the establishment and examination of criteria and guidelines with respect to hypoxia by custom-made definitions.},

	abstract = {Lake warming can negatively impact cool-water fishes through both temperature and oxygen stress. We modeled the joint dynamics of water column temperature and oxygen to quantify oxythermal habitat for yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in Fish Lake, Wisconsin, USA. To estimate annual oxythermal stress, we developed a novel metric (cumulative oxythermal stress dosage; COSD) that integrates both stress duration and stress magnitude. We find that COSD better predicts observed perch declines than the published TDO3 metric (temperature at depth where dissolved oxygen is 3 mg·L
              −1
              ), which was developed for cold-water fish. Simulations show increases in COSD between 1911 and 2014, punctuated by a sharp rise since 1989. Extreme COSD years result from the intersection of high maximum daily dosage and prolonged duration exceeding the tolerance threshold. Temperature perturbation experiments to explore future climate scenarios reveal that COSD would increase greatly if the atmosphere warms by {\textgreater}3 °C. Applying the COSD metric broadly to temperate lakes could help direct management efforts toward the ecosystems most likely to serve as climate refugia for cold- and cool-water fishes in the future.},

	abstract = {Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution.
            The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive.
            The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January–June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90\% BMA prediction intervals were 66\% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7\% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8\% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed.},

	abstract = {We quantified summer internal phosphorus (P) loads and all the major P fluxes in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, a deep stratified eutrophic lake, during two summers of contrasting external loads to determine (i) whether internal loading by entrainment (mixing at the thermocline) is a significant part of the epilimnetic P budget and (ii) what factors lead to interannual variability in internal loading. We estimated variables for the P budget weekly (standing stock, sedimentation) or daily (outflow, inflow, and entrainment) during a summer of average runoff (1992) and one of higher than average runoff (1993). Entrainment, estimated by calculating the amount of P transported into the epilimnion after the thermocline deepened following storms, was about 10 times higher than external loading during 1992, but was about equal to external loading during 1993. When entrainment was included, the epilimnetic P budget balanced. Interannual variability in internal loading appears to be due to a combination of water column stability, weather, and the P levels accumulated in the metalimnion. External loads to the epilimnion during summer 1993 were much higher than in 1992 (7.0 and 0.9 mg P ·m

	abstract = {Eutrophication increases hypoxia in lakes and reservoirs, causing deleterious effects on biological communities. Quantitative models would help managers develop effective strategies to address hypoxia issues, but most existing models are limited in their applicability to lakes with temporally resolved dissolved oxygen data. We describe a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts dissolved oxygen in lakes based on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the development of hypoxia during summer stratification. These factors include the days elapsed since stratification, dissolved organic carbon concentration, lake depth, and chlorophyll concentration. We demonstrate that the model can be fit to two datasets: one in which temporally resolved dissolved oxygen profiles were collected from 20 lakes in a single state and one in which single profiles were collected from 381 lakes across the United States. Analyses of these two datasets yielded similar relationships between volumetric oxygen demand and chlorophyll concentration, suggesting that the model structure appropriately represented the effects of eutrophication on oxygen depletion. Combining both datasets in a single model further improved the precision of predictions.},

	abstract = {Despite growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services and the economic and ecological harm caused by invasive species, linkages between invasions, changes in ecosystem functioning, and in turn, provisioning of ecosystem services remain poorly documented and poorly understood. We evaluate the economic impacts of an invasion that cascaded through a food web to cause substantial declines in water clarity, a valued ecosystem service. The predatory zooplankton, the spiny water flea (
              Bythotrephes longimanus
              ), invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1980s and has subsequently undergone secondary spread to inland lakes, including Lake Mendota (Wisconsin), in 2009. In Lake Mendota,
              Bythotrephes
              has reached unparalleled densities compared with in other lakes, decreasing biomass of the grazer
              Daphnia pulicaria
              and causing a decline in water clarity of nearly 1 m. Time series modeling revealed that the loss in water clarity, valued at US\$140 million (US\$640 per household), could be reversed by a 71\% reduction in phosphorus loading. A phosphorus reduction of this magnitude is estimated to cost between US\$86.5 million and US\$163 million (US\$430–US\$810 per household). Estimates of the economic effects of Great Lakes invasive species may increase considerably if cases of secondary invasions into inland lakes, such as Lake Mendota, are included. Furthermore, such extreme cases of economic damages call for increased investment in the prevention and control of invasive species to better maximize the economic benefits of such programs. Our results highlight the need to more fully incorporate ecosystem services into our analysis of invasive species impacts, management, and public policy.},

Although it is known that seasonal patterns in nutrient availability are key drivers of both stream metabolism and eutrophication, there has been little success in developing a comprehensive understanding of seasonal variations in nutrient export across watersheds or of the relationship between nutrient seasonality and watershed characteristics. In the present study, we have used concentration and discharge data from more than 200 stations across U.S. and Canadian watersheds to identify (1) archetypal seasonal concentration regimes for nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total phosphorus, and (2) dominant watershed controls on these regimes across a gradient of climate, land use, and topography. Our analysis shows that less impacted watersheds, with more forested and wetland area, most commonly exhibit concentration regimes that are in phase with discharge, with concentration lows occurring during summer low-ﬂow periods. Agricultural watersheds also commonly exhibit in-phase behavior, though the seasonality is usually muted compared to that seen in less impacted areas. With increasing urban area, however, nutrient concentrations frequently become essentially aseasonal or even exhibit clearly outof-phase behavior. In addition, our data indicate that seasonal SRP concentration patterns may be strongly inﬂuenced by proximal controls such as the presence of dams and reservoirs. In all, these results suggest that human activity is signiﬁcantly altering nutrient concentration regimes, with large potential consequences for both in-stream metabolism and eutrophication risk in downstream waterbodies.},

The book offers instructions on how to measure the level of performance of stormwater treatment practices directly and bases proposed maintenance schedules on actual performance and historical maintenance efforts and costs. The inspection methods, which are proven in the field and have been implemented successfully, are necessary as regulatory agencies are demanding evaluations of the performance of stormwater treatment practices. The authors have developed a three-tiered approach that offers readers a standard protocol for how to determine the effectiveness of stormwater treatment practices currently in place.},

The anoxic factor (AF, days per year or per season) estimates the number of days that a sediment area equal to the lake surface area is overlain by anoxic water. It can be expressed separately as summer or winter AE Stepwise multiple-regression models were constructed with AF and common physical and chemical variables to predict fish species richness. Because some of the parametric regression assumptions were violated, the traditional statistics were evaluated with randomization tests to confirm significance. The best regression models included summer AF or lake surface area, or winter AF and mean depth, for subsets of acidic and circumneutral lakes; these models explained up to 75\% of the variation in fish species richness. One of the models can be used to estimate the likelihood of winterkill. Anoxic factor was also correlated with the number of coldwater fish species present. The concept of AF can be used to model the distribution and number of fish species in stratified lakes and should be useful in the management of oxygen-dependent aquatic animals (e.g., finfish and shrimp) in freshwater and marine habitats.},

Anoxia can be expressed and quantified as the anoxic factor; hypoxia, for a specific level of oxygen depletion, can be expressed as the hypoxic factor in lakes, reservoirs, and river sections. These methods summarize information of individual dissolved oxygen profiles as annual values or factors that facilitate comparison between and within lakes. Therefore, these factors are useful in the formulation and testing of hypotheses related to the dissolved oxygen status in water bodies. Methods of calculating different factors for different oxygen levels and water layers, including those applying separately to the epilimnion and hypolimnion, are presented in detail. Proven and potential applicability include: (1) the quantification of relationships with lake water quality variables and lake classification (trophic state), (2) the evaluation of restoration techniques with respect to their effects on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, (3) the determination of internal phosphorus loading in stratified and polymictic lakes, (4) the exploration of habitat constraints due to hypoxia (e.g., fish species richness and winterkill), (5) forecasting potential effects of climatic change on oxygen content and internal phosphorus loading, and (6) the establishment and examination of criteria and guidelines with respect to hypoxia by custom-made definitions.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the reductions in P loading needed to control blue-green algal blooms in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. After developing a 21-year loading data set, we used a P mass balance model expressed as a difference equation with an annual time step indexed from mid-April. We defined and estimated a loss parameter λ as the proportion of the lake’s April P concentration lost through sedimentation and outflow during the following year. Using the distribution of annual λ’s and input loadings, we predicted the steady-state distribution of April P concentrations that would result from scenarios of altered inputs due to changes in management practices. These results were then linked to the probability of summer blue-green algal blooms. For no load reduction, the probability of a bloom ({\textgreater}2 mg algaeиL–1) on any summer day is about 60\%. This probability decreases to 20\% with a load reduction of 50\%. Our approach illustrates how managers can consider reducing the frequency of extreme events like algal blooms, which may correspond more to the public’s perception of lake water quality than average conditions.},

An alternative is using models, which summarise the knowledge of the functioning of the system so that they can be used to answer specific questions. We present a model to calculate the epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature of inland water bodies based on air temperature and on their geographical and morphological characteristics. The seven model parameters were parameterized by using official monitoring data and the satellite temperature data of the data set LakeSST for French water bodies. The performance of the parameterised model was compared to that of two widely used models (FLake and air2water with four parameters). The model showed a good performance in the simulation of epilimnion temperatures, especially in the summer. For hypolimnion temperatures the performance was worse, but still comparable to that of other models. Because of its good performance and the few data needed to run the model, it is a good choice for managers interested in the thermal behaviour of inland water bodies.},

	abstract = {Volcanic lakes are characterized by physicochemical favorable conditions for the development of reservoirs of C-bearing greenhouse gases that can be dispersed to air during occasional rollover events. By combining a microbiological and geochemical approach, we showed that the chemistry of the CO2- and CH4-rich gas reservoir hosted within the meromictic Lake Averno (Campi Flegrei, southern Italy) are related to the microbial niche differentiation along the vertical water column. The simultaneous occurrence of diverse functional groups of microbes operating under different conditions suggests that these habitats harbor complex microbial consortia that impact on the production and consumption of greenhouse gases. In the epilimnion, the activity of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic biota, together with CO2 dissolution at relatively high pH, enhanced CO2- and CH4 consumption, which also occurred in the hypolimnion. Moreover, results from computations carried out to evaluate the dependence of the lake stability on the CO2/CH4 ratios, suggested that the water density vertical gradient was mainly controlled by salinity and temperature, whereas the effect of dissolved gases was minor, excepting if extremely high increases of CH4 are admitted. Therefore, biological processes, controlling the composition of CO2 and CH4, contributed to stabilize the lake stratification of the lake. Overall, Lake Averno, and supposedly the numerous worldwide distributed volcanic lakes having similar features (namely bio-activity lakes), acts as a sink for the CO2 supplied from the hydrothermal/magmatic system, displaying a significant influence on the local carbon budget.},

This accuracy for the lake storage could not be achieved by other methods, especially if conditions were difficult, e.g. snowfall, or in cases when precipitation was small. Finally, the pressure measurement – originally intended to roughly determine the water level – turned out to be a direct measurement of water mass in the lake, which was the proper magnitude for exchanges between atmosphere and lake. Hence the measurement of lake storage could become an interesting approach even for meteorological measurements, such as precipitation and evaporation on a water surface.},

Secondly, we investigated the effects of temperature stratification on substance mass transport using the three-dimensional model. The advective and dispersive transport for a tracer released in a river and in a side arm of the reservoir were quantified. We identified that considering the effects of temperature stratification increased the horizontal advective transport - up to a maximum of 40\% increase for the tracer released in the river, and 9\% for the side arm. In relation to dispersive transport there was a decrease in transport due to temperature stratification, and no pattern was discernible for the side arm tracer modeling.Keywords:  Reservoirs; Heat transport model; One-dimensional; Three-dimensional},

Using novel technologies, temporal and spatial patterns of water-column oxygenation, from basin-scale seasonal patterns to meter-scale sub-micromolar oxygen distributions, were resolved. Existing multidecadal monitoring data were used to demonstrate the imprint of climate change and eutrophication on long-term oxygen distributions. Organic and inorganic proxies were used to extend investigations on past oxygen conditions to centennial and even longer timescales that cannot be resolved by monitoring. The effects of hypoxia on faunal communities and biogeochemical processes were also addressed in the project. An investigation of benthic fauna is presented as an example of hypoxia-devastated benthic communities that slowly recover upon a reduction in eutrophication in a system where naturally occurring hypoxia overlaps with anthropogenic hypoxia. Biogeochemical investigations reveal that oxygen intrusions have a strong effect on the microbially mediated redox cycling of elements. Observations and modeling studies of the sediments demonstrate the effect of seasonally changing oxygen conditions on benthic mineralization pathways and fluxes. Data quality and access are crucial in hypoxia research. Technical issues are therefore also addressed, including the availability of suitable sensor technology to resolve the gradual changes in bottom-water oxygen in marine systems that can be expected as a result of climate change. Using cabled observatories as examples, we show how the benefit of continuous oxygen monitoring can be maximized by adopting proper quality control. Finally, we discuss strategies for state-of-the-art data archiving and dissemination in compliance with global standards, and how ocean observations can contribute to global earth observation attempts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The (Lower) Lake of Zurich provides an ideal system for studying the long-term impact of environmental change on deep-water hypoxia because of its sensitivity to climatic forcing, its history of eutrophication and subsequent oligotrophication, and the quality and length of its data set. Based on 39 years (1972–2010) of measured profiles of temperature, oxygen concentration and phosphorus (P) concentration, the potentially confounding effects of oligotrophication and climatic forcing on the occurrence and extent of deep-water hypoxia in the lake were investigated. The time-series of Nürnberg's hypoxic factor (HF) for the lake can be divided into three distinct segments: (i) a segment of consistently low HF from 1972 to the late-1980s climate regime shift (CRS); (ii) a transitional segment between the late-1980s CRS and approximately 2000 within which the HF was highly variable; and (iii) a segment of consistently high HF thereafter. The increase in hypoxia during the study period was not a consequence of a change in trophic status, as the lake underwent oligotrophication as a result of reduced external P loading during this time. Instead, wavelet analysis suggests that changes in the lake's mixing regime, initiated by the late-1980s CRS, ultimately led to a delayed but abrupt decrease in the deep-water oxygen concentration, resulting in a general expansion of the hypoxic zone in autumn. Even after detrending to remove long-term effects, the concentration of soluble reactive P in the bottom water of the lake was highly correlated with various measures of hypoxia, providing quantitative evidence supporting the probable effect of hypoxia on internal P loading. Such climate-induced, ecosystem-scale changes, which may result in undesirable effects such as a decline in water quality and a reduction in coldwater fish habitats, provide further evidence for the vulnerability of large temperate lakes to predicted increases in global air temperature.},

The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

Adding a linear factor for water depth further improved the model indicating that oxygen depletion increased substantially along the depth. Two other factors turned out to significantly influence ODR: total phosphorus as a proxy for the lake’s trophic state and mean oxygen concentration in the respective depth layer.

Absorption of solar radiation by the dystrophic waters, effective shelter from wind-induced turbulence, and considerable relative depths all combine to prevent mixing of heat much below the surface 2 m of most study lakes. Birgean wind-work values therefore remain low, and cold hypolimnetic waters occupy much of the lake volume. The lakes also respond quickly to meteorological change, which causes considerable year-to-year variation, and some short-term fluctuation, in their heat budgets and maximum stabilities.

	abstract = {By contrast to the more regular and predictable temperate lakes, heat budgets and temperature dynamics in Mediterranean reservoirs are characterized by a marked interannual variability. In the present paper, the heat content, annual Birgean heat budget (ABHB), and thermal structure of Sau Reservoir were examined during a period of hypolimnetic withdrawal between 1980 and 1985, and during a period of withdrawal at intermediate depths between 1996 and 2003. The two study periods were also characterized by a wide range of stored water volume fluctuations. Results were used to develop and validate an empirical model to predict annual and monthly heat dynamics statistics and mixed layer depth as a function of hydraulic management parameters such as water volume and selective withdrawal depth. During the hypolimnetic withdrawal period elevated ABHB and deep mixed layer depths were recorded in the reservoir, which behaved as a heat trap. By contrast, intermediate depth withdrawal promoted a shallower and more stable thermocline, thus increasing the cold hypolimnetic water volume and decreasing heat content and ABHB. The study reveals that hydraulic management constitutes the main driver of the heat and thermal dynamics in reservoirs with multiple withdrawal outlets. By contrast with the increasing temperature trends recorded in many natural lakes, the hydraulic management in Sau Reservoir induced a progressive reduction in water temperature and heat content in the system, thus partially counteracting the possible deleterious effects of global warming. Our intensive study in a single, highly-dynamic ecosystem constitutes a new approximation to the study of thermal structure and heat dynamics in water bodies. (© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

These factors allowed only surface waters to contribute to the annual heat exchange cycle, thereby reducing the magnitude of each lake's heat budgets and influencing stability and wind work values. The lakes show considerable short- and long-term fluctuations in heat content, stability and wind work values in response to the capricious maritime meteorological conditions of the area. However, long periods between successive samplings may have caused some underestimation of the ranges of these three parameters.

After the cold winter 2008–2009, a heat wave starting in May turned the whole year 2009 the second hottest after 2003. The particular sequence of meteorological events resulted in extreme vertical temperature gradients and unusually high thermal stability of both lakes.

Due to the large wind exposed surface, wind mixing was supposedly the dominating mechanism of heat transfer in the shallower eutrophic Lake Varese where, due to low water transparency, large amount of solar energy trapped in the upper layers markedly increased the thermal stability. In the deeper and more transparent Lake Monate, the deeper penetrating solar irradiance contributed to better energy dissipation within the water column and smaller interannual differences in thermal stability.},

GLM was developed to support the science needs of the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), a network of researchers using sensors to understand lake functioning and address questions about how lakes around the world respond to climate and land use change. The scale and diversity of lake types, locations, and sizes, and the expanding observational datasets created the need for a robust community model of lake dynamics with sufficient flexibility to accommodate a range of scientific and management questions relevant to the GLEON community. This paper summarizes the scientific basis and numerical implementation of the model algorithms, including details of sub-models that simulate surface heat exchange and ice cover dynamics, vertical mixing, and inflow–outflow dynamics. We demonstrate the suitability of the model for different lake types that vary substantially in their morphology, hydrology, and climatic conditions. GLM supports a dynamic coupling with biogeochemical and ecological modelling libraries for integrated simulations of water quality and ecosystem health, and options for integration with other environmental models are outlined. Finally, we discuss utilities for the analysis of model outputs and uncertainty assessments, model operation within a distributed cloud-computing environment, and as a tool to support the learning of network participants.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Despite growing evidence that climate change will increase temperature variability and the frequency of temperature extremes, many modeling studies that analyze the effects of warming scenarios on cyanobacteria in lakes examine uniform warming temperature scenarios without including any variability. Here, we used the one-dimensional hydrodynamic General Lake Model coupled to Aquatic EcoDynamics modules (GLM-AED) to simulate 11 years of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial biomass in Lake Mendota (Madison, WI, USA). We developed climate scenarios with either uniform (constant) warming or variable warming based on random sampling of daily air temperatures from either a normal or Poisson probability distribution. We found that while the median cyanobacterial biomass among repeated simulations for each of the years was similar regardless of whether or not air temperature variability was included in the climate scenarios, the randomly-sampled air temperature distribution scenarios exhibited much greater variability in the year-to-year cyanobacterial biomass estimates. Our results suggest that including temperature variability in climate scenarios may substantially change our understanding of how climate warming may alter cyanobacterial blooms over yearly to decadal time scales. To more effectively predict the range of possible future cyanobacterial dynamics, both the magnitude and variability of warming must be considered when developing climate scenarios for lake modeling studies.},

	abstract = {Many lakes show vertical stratification of their water masses, at least for some extended time periods. Density differences in water bodies facilitate an evolution of chemical differences with many consequences for living organisms in lakes. Temperature and dissolved substances contribute to density differences in water. The atmosphere imposes a temperature signal on the lake surface. As a result, thermal stratification can be established during the warm season if a lake is sufficiently deep. On the contrary, during the cold period, surface cooling forces vertical circulation of water masses and removal of gradients of water properties. However, gradients of dissolved substances may be sustained for periods much longer than one annual cycle. Such lakes do not experience full overturns. Gradients may be a consequence of external inflows or groundwater seepage. In addition, photosynthesis at the lake surface and subsequent decomposition of organic material in the deeper layers of a lake can sustain a gradient of dissolved substances. Three more geochemical cycles, namely, calcite precipitation, iron cycle, and manganese cycle, are known for sustaining meromixis. A limited number of lakes do not experience a complete overturn because of pressure dependence of temperature of maximum density. Such lakes must be sufficiently deep and lie in the appropriate climate zone. Although these lakes are permanently stratified, deep waters are well ventilated, and chemical differences are small. Turbulent mixing and convective deep water renewal must be very effective. As a consequence, these lakes usually are not termed meromictic. Permanent stratification may also be created by episodic partial recharging of the deep water layer. This mechanism resembles the cycling of the ocean: horizontal gradients result from gradients at the surface, such as differential cooling or enhanced evaporation in adjacent shallow side bays. Dense water parcels can be formed which intrude the deep water layer. In the final section, stratification relevant physical properties, such as sound speed, hydrostatic pressure, electrical conductivity, and density, are discussed. The assumptions behind salinity, electrical conductance, potential density, and potential temperature are introduced. Finally, empirical and theoretical approaches for quantitative evaluation from easy to measure properties conclude this contribution.},

	abstract = {Much remains unknown about what drives microbial community structure and diversity. Highly structured environments might offer clues. For example, it may be possible to identify metabolically similar species as groups of organisms that correlate spatially with the geochemical processes they carry out. Here, we use a 16S ribosomal RNA gene survey in a lake that has chemical gradients across its depth to identify groups of spatially correlated but phylogenetically diverse organisms. Some groups had distributions across depth that aligned with the distributions of metabolic processes predicted by a biogeochemical model, suggesting that these groups performed biogeochemical functions. A single-cell genetic assay showed, however, that the groups associated with one biogeochemical process, sulfate reduction, contained only a few organisms that have the genes required to reduce sulfate. These results raise the possibility that some of these spatially correlated groups are consortia of phylogenetically diverse and metabolically different microbes that cooperate to carry out geochemical functions.},

As oxygen depletion is expected to worsen with altered land use and climate change, understanding how chemical and microbial dynamics impact dead zones will aid modeling efforts to guide remediation strategies.

	abstract = {Global urbanization trends impose major alterations on surface waters. This includes impacts on ecosystem functioning that can involve feedbacks on climate through changes in rates of greenhouse gas emissions. The combination of high nutrient supply and shallow depth typical of urban freshwaters is particularly conducive to high rates of methane (CH4) production and emission, suggesting a potentially important role in the global CH4 cycle. However, there is a lack of comprehensive flux data from diverse urban water bodies, of information on the underlying drivers, and of estimates for whole cities. Based on measurements over four seasons in a total of 32 water bodies in the city of Berlin, Germany, we calculate the total CH4 emission from various types of surface waters of a large city in temperate climate at 2.6 ± 1.7 Gg CH4 yr-1.The average total emission was 219 ± 490 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. Water-chemical variables were surprisingly poor predictors of total CH4 emissions, and proxies of productivity and oxygen conditions had low explanatory power as well, suggesting a complex combination of factors governing CH4 fluxes from urban surface waters. However, small water bodies (area {\textless}1 ha) typically located in urban green spaces were identified as emission hotspots. These results help constrain assessments of CH4 emissions from freshwaters in the world's growing cities, facilitating extrapolation of urban emissions to large areas, including at the global scale.

	abstract = {Shallow fluvial lakes are dynamic ecosystems shaped by physical and biological factors and characterized by the coexistence of phytoplankton and macrophytes. Due to multiple interplaying factors, understanding the distribution of phytoplankton in fluvial lakes is a complex but fundamental issue, in the context of increasing eutrophication, climate change, and multiple water uses. We analyze the distribution of phytoplankton by combining remotely sensed maps of chlorophyll-a with a hydrodynamic model in a dammed fluvial lake (Mantua Superior Lake, Northern Italy). The numerical simulation of different conditions shows that the main hydrodynamic effects which influence algal distribution are related to the combined effect of advection due to wind forces and local currents, as well as to the presence of large gyres which induce recirculation and stagnation regions, favoring phytoplankton accumulation. Therefore, the general characters of the phytoplankton horizontal patchiness can be inferred from the results of the hydrodynamic model. Conversely, hyperspectral remote-sensing products can be used to validate this model, as they provide chlorophyll-a distribution maps. The integration of ecological, hydraulic, and remote-sensing techniques may therefore help the monitoring and protection of inland water quality, with important improvements in management actions by policy makers.},

Urban stormwater runoff, which degrades streams through altered volume, pattern and quality of flow, presents a problem that challenges dominant approaches to stormwater and water resource management, and to environmental flow assessment. We used evidence of ecological response to different stormwater drainage systems to develop methods for input to environmental flow assessment. We identified the nature of hydrologic change resulting from conventional urban stormwater runoff, and the mechanisms by which such hydrologic change is prevented in streams where ecological condition has been protected. We also quantified the increase in total volume resulting from urban stormwater runoff, by comparing annual streamflow volumes from undeveloped catchments with the volumes that would run off impervious surfaces under the same rainfall regimes. In catchments with as little as 5–10\% total imperviousness, conventional stormwater drainage, associated with poor in-stream ecological condition, reduces contributions to baseflows and increases the frequency and magnitude of storm flows, but in similarly impervious catchments in which streams retain good ecological condition, informal drainage to forested hillslopes, without a direct piped discharge to the stream, results in little such hydrologic change. In urbanized catchments, dispersed urban stormwater retention measures can potentially protect urban stream ecosystems by mimicking the hydrologic effects of informal drainage, if sufficient water is harvested and kept out of the stream, and if discharged water is treated to a suitable quality. Urban stormwater is a new class of environmental flow problem: one that requires reduction of a large excess volume of water to maintain riverine ecological integrity. It is the best type of problem, because solving it provides an opportunity to solve other problems such as the provision of water for human use.},

From this time to the present, extensive limnological data on the lake's water quality have been collected which have been used to validate a one-dimensional water quality model. Three cases are discussed: full operation of a network of 15 aerators, intermittent operation as water quality improved and no aeration as is the present situation. The effect of the hypolimnetic aerator was modelled once as a stirrer and also as a bubbler. While both are designed to impart mechanical energy to the water column to promote mixing by means of a column of bubbles, stirrers are meant to restrict the mixing between the epilimnion and hypolimnion by collecting the bubble streams before they penetrate the upper layer. On the other hand, for bubblers the bubble column continues unimpeded to the surface. We conclude that the design of the hypolimnetic aerators employed in Lake Tegel behave more closely to a bubble plume and thus there is considerable mixing between the hypolimnion and epilimnion.},

	abstract = {ADCP and temperature chain measurements have been used to estimate the rate of energy input by wind stress to the water surface in the south basin of Windermere. The energy input from the atmosphere was found to increase markedly as the lake stratified in spring. The efficiency of energy transfer (Eff), defined as the ratio of the rate of working in near-surface waters (RW) to that above the lake surface (P 10), increased from ∼0.0013 in vertically homogenous conditions to ∼0.0064 in the first 40 days of the stratified regime. A maximum value of Eff∼0.01 was observed when, with increasing stratification, the first mode internal seiche period decreased to match the diurnal wind period of 24 h. The increase in energy input, following the onset of stratification was reflected in enhancement of the mean depth-varying kinetic energy without a corresponding increase in wind forcing. Parallel estimates of energy dissipation in the bottom boundary layer, based on determination of the structure function show that it accounts for ∼15\% of RW in stratified conditions. The evolution of stratification in the lake conforms to a heating stirring model which indicates that mixing accounts for ∼21\% of RW. Taken together, these estimates of key energetic parameters point the way to the development of full energy budgets for lakes and shallow seas.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather can have a substantial influence on lakes and is expected to become more frequent with climate change. We explored the influence of one particular extreme event, Storm Ophelia, on the physical and chemical environment of England’s largest lake, Windermere. We found that the substantial influence of Ophelia on meteorological conditions at Windermere, in particular wind speed, resulted in a 25-fold increase (relative to the study-period average) in the wind energy flux at the lake-air interface. Following Ophelia, there was a short-lived mixing event in which the Schmidt stability decreased by over 100 Jm−2 and the thermocline deepened by over 10 m during a 12-h period. As a result of changes to the strength of stratification, Ophelia also changed the internal seiche regime of Windermere with the dominant seiche period increasing from {\textasciitilde} 17 h pre-storm to {\textasciitilde} 21 h post-storm. Following Ophelia, there was an upwelling of cold and low-oxygenated waters at the southern-end of the lake. This had a substantial influence on the main outflow of Windermere, the River Leven, where dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased by {\textasciitilde} 48\%, from 9.3 to 4.8 mg L−1, while at the mid-lake monitoring station in Windermere, it decreased by only {\textasciitilde} 3\%. This study illustrates that the response of a lake to extreme weather can cause important effects downstream, the influence of which may not be evident at the lake surface. To understand the impact of future extreme events fully, the whole lake and downstream-river system need to be studied together.},

	abstract = {Concepts of age, residence time, transit time, and turn-over time are summarized which are useful for describing the exchange and transport of water or materials in a coastal sea. The age of a particle is defined as a time which has elapsed since it entered the reservoir, and the residence time is defined as a time which will be taken for a particle to reach the outlet. Time scales based on the age are simply related with those based on the residence time. It is shown that a suitable time scale for representing the exchange characteristics is the average residence time and not the turnover time, which has often been used as the exchange time scale. Further, the ‘remnant function’ which describes the phenomena of exchange or transport is introduced, and is related to the residence time. Exchange and transport time scales in a coastal sea are discussed on the basis of the residence time which can be applied to not only steady-state cases, but also the cases where material is injected instantaneously. The average residence time in a one-dimensional channel and bay is obtained from the solutions of the advection-diffusion equation. If we know a flow speed and diffusion coefficient in a channel or bay regarded as one-dimensional, we can translate them into the average residence time. As an example, the average residence time of the Seto Inland Sea is discussed.},

	abstract = {In the context of aquatic biogeochemical modelling, there is an increasing pressure to explicitly treat multiple biogeochemical cycles and to increase the functional diversity of biotic communities. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of 124 aquatic biogeochemical models to reproduce the dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups. Our analysis reinforces earlier findings that aquatic ecosystem modellers do not seem to consistently apply conventional methodological steps during the development of their models. Although there is an improvement relative to earlier critiques, significant portion of published studies did not properly assess model sensitivity to input vectors; aquatic ecosystem modellers are still reluctant to embrace optimization techniques during model calibration; and assess the ability of their models to support predictions in the extrapolation domain. We also found significant variability with respect to the mathematical representation of key physiological processes (e.g., growth strategies, nutrient kinetics, settling velocities) as well as group-specific characterizations typically considered in the pertinent literature. Cyanobacteria blooms are a major concern for water industries as they represent high risk for human health and economic costs for drinking water treatment, and thus one of the outstanding challenges is to offer credible modelling tools that can serve as early warning systems to assist with the operational control of cyanobacteria blooms. Our study suggests that the derivation of distinct functional groups from fairly heterogeneous planktonic assemblages poses challenging problems. Because of the still poorly understood ecology, we do not have robust group-specific parameterizations that can support predictions in a wide array of spatiotemporal domains. In this context, we argue that the most prudent strategies are the gradual incorporation of complexity, where possible and relevant, along with an open dialogue on how we can mathematically depict the interconnections among different phytoplankton subunits or even how we can frame the suitable data collection efforts.},

	abstract = {Lake Tegel (Berlin, Germany) is controlled by two main inflows: inflow \#1 (River Havel) is heavily phosphorus-laden, whereas inflow \#2 is an artificial confluence that includes discharge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant distinguished by high levels of phosphorus and pharmaceuticals. To reduce the phosphorus load on the lake, a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP) is situated at inflow \#2. Moreover, the two inflows are short-circuited by a pipeline that transfers part of the inflow \#1 water to the PEP and finally releases it into inflow \#2. The pipeline and the PEP have contributed to a continuous reduction in the total phosphorus concentration of Lake Tegel in the past 25 years. We investigate the question of whether the existing lake pipeline can also be used to reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals in Lake Tegel originating from inflow \#2 by dilution with water from River Havel, by diverting part of inflow \#2 around the lake, or by a combination of both strategies. The circulation pattern of Lake Tegel is complicated by complex bathymetry and numerous islands and is therefore highly sensitive to winds. We tested seven different management scenarios by hydrodynamic modeling for a period of 16 years with the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). None of the scenarios provided a strategy optimal for both pharmaceuticals and phosphorus. Nonetheless, compound regimes, such as alternating the pipe flow direction or adding another pipeline, allowed the most abundant pharmaceutical (carbamazepine) to be reduced while maintaining the current phosphorus level. This study demonstrates the ability of immediate lake regulation measures to maintain water quality. In the case of Lake Tegel, the pipeline can be fully effective with regard to pharmaceuticals only in combination with additional efforts such as advanced pharmaceutical treatment of wastewater and/or phosphorus reduction in the River Havel catchment.},

Because the contributions of each inflow have not yet been quantified and because the lake features complex bathymetry and numerous islands, a hydrodynamic circulation model with high spatial resolution and dynamic wind forcing is useful. We applied the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model to separate the influences of wind and river discharge on the currents and mass transport in Lake Tegel. For model validation, we compared the simulation results with 1 year of electrical conductivity data, which was used as a conservative tracer to distinguish between water from the River Havel and water supplied by a smaller second inflow. Calculation of currents alone is insufficient to investigate water exchanges between rivers and lakes, especially when several islands create multiple pathways for river intrusion. Therefore, mass transport simulations are applied. Our calculations based on archetypical scenarios indicate that the proportion of (polluted) water from the River Havel in the main basin of Lake Tegel fluctuates with river discharge and wind, which either amplify or neutralize each other.},

	abstract = {Climate change is rapidly warming aquatic ecosystems including lakes and reservoirs. However, variability in lake characteristics can modulate how lakes respond to climate. Water clarity is especially important both because it influences the depth range over which heat is absorbed, and because it is changing in many lakes. Here, we show that simulated long-term water clarity trends influence how both surface and bottom water temperatures of lakes and reservoirs respond to climate change. Clarity changes can either amplify or suppress climate-induced warming, depending on lake depth and the direction of clarity change. Using a process-based model to simulate 1894 north temperate lakes from 1979 to 2012, we show that a scenario of decreasing clarity at a conservative yet widely observed rate of 0.92\% yr−1 warmed surface waters and cooled bottom waters at rates comparable in magnitude to climate-induced warming. For lakes deeper than 6.5 m, decreasing clarity was sufficient to fully offset the effects of climate-induced warming on median whole-lake mean temperatures. Conversely, a scenario increasing clarity at the same rate cooled surface waters and warmed bottom waters relative to baseline warming rates. Furthermore, in 43\% of lakes, increasing clarity more than doubled baseline bottom temperature warming rates. Long-term empirical observations of water temperature in lakes with and without clarity trends support these simulation results. Together, these results demonstrate that water clarity trends may be as important as rising air temperatures in determining how waterbodies respond to climate change.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in water quality modeling is adequately representing the changing state of aquatic ecosystems as accurately as possible, but with appropriate mathematical relationships without creating a highly complex and overly parameterized model. A model more complex than necessary will require more input and results in unaffordable calibration times. In this work we propose and test a calibration strategy for a one-dimensional dynamic physical–ecological model (DYRESM–CAEDYM) to reproduce the seasonal changes in the functional composition of the phytoplankton community existing in El Gergal reservoir (Seville, Spain). The community is described as a succession of functional groups with different response to environmental conditions. First, we performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters to include in the calibration process, and then applied a global optimization algorithm to fit the model for each algal group in a sequential fashion. Finally we simulated all the functional groups adopting parameter values established during the group-by-group calibrations. Our results show that the performance of this approach is strictly related with: (1) the level of system description (i.e. the model structure and the number of functional groups simulated); (2) the level of information included in the calibration process (i.e. the observations); and (3) the non-linear interactions among functional groups. Functional segmentation of the model should be minimized even though groups with different environmental requirements must be discriminated. Although magnitudes of biomass peaks were not always estimated correctly, the calibrated model was able to predict peak sequence and timing of dominant phytoplankton groups. Thus our study showed that: (1) model structure and nature of observations adopted have to be in agreement with the level of organization in the system; (2) integration of automatic calibration strategies is a useful approach in complex deterministic ecological models.},

We identify a number of shortcomings related to these studies and conduct an extensive simulation study where we compare a larger number of rules available and develop some new methods. In total we compare 20 stopping rules and propose a two-step approach that appears to be highly effective. First, a Bartlett's test is used to test the significance of the first principal component, indicating whether or not at least two variables share common variation in the entire data set. If significant, a number of different rules can be applied to estimate the number of non-trivial components to be retained. However, the relative merits of these methods depend on whether data contain strongly correlated or uncorrelated variables. We also estimate the number of non-trivial components for a number of field data sets so that we can evaluate the applicability of our conclusions based on simulated data.},

Here we show that long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with expected future conditions. If a scientifically guided management plan to mitigate these impacts is not implemented, we can therefore expect this bloom to be a harbinger of future blooms in Lake Erie.},

Besides the harmful algae blooms (HAB) and a severe prolonged drought, the bay has a strategic importance—e.g., the eastern channel of the newly built water diversion will withdraw water from it (drinking water). This article presents the implementation of a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model—pioneering for the region—using TELEMAC-3D. The aim was to investigate the 3D flows induced by moderate or extreme winds as well as by heating of the water surface. The findings showed that a windstorm increased the flow velocities (at least one order of magnitude, i.e., up to 10−1–10−2 m/s) without altering significantly the circulation patterns; this occurred substantially for the heating scenario, which had, in contrast, a lower effect on velocities. In terms of the bay’s management, the main implications are: (1) the withdrawals for drinking water and irrigation agriculture should stop working during windstorms and at least three days afterwards; (2) a heating of the water surface would likely increase the risk of development of HAB in the shallow areas, so that further assessments with a water quality module are needed to support advanced remediation measures; (3) the 3D model proves to be a necessary tool to identify high risk contamination areas e.g., for installation of new aquaculture systems.},

Prescribed values of tidal harmonics were used to force the model at the two open boundaries of the model domain. The numerical experiments performed consisted of the instantaneous injection, of a passive hypothetical tracer at 100\% concentration, to the whole coastal lagoon which was subject to the wind action and tidal forcing. The results indicate that influence time fluctuated between a few days and 4.0 months. The longest values were predicted close to the Talchichitle Island in the eastern part of the lagoon while the shortest were found close to the inlets where the relatively deep channels and high speed tidal currents favor the discharge of the tracer into the ocean.

We estimated changes in water temperatures, the Wedderburn number, and the buoyancy frequency, as well as concentrations of dissolved oxygen and phosphate under climate change using a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model coupled to a water quality model. Further, we investigated how four management scenarios with varying discharges of the PEP could affect the lake system. In all simulations, water temperatures increased and summer stratification extended. The modeling results demonstrated that the water management system buffers the high nutrient supply from the river inflow and can effectively mitigate negative effects of climate change on Lake Tegel, thus highlighting its importance for the lake ecosystem.},

Over much of the past century, the wastewater treatment in Berlin, Germany, relied on inefficient sewage farms, which resulted in severe eutrophication and sediment contamination in the recipient surface waterbodies. A prominent example is Lake Tegel, where a multitude of management measures were applied in the last decades for the purpose of ecosystem restoration. In this study, we analyzed sediment cores of three lakes with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy: Lake Tegel, Lake Großer Wannsee, which is environmentally similar but has a different management history, and Lake Userin, which serves as a reference located in a nature protection area. Multivariate statistical methods (principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and self-organizing maps) were used to assess the sediment quality and to reconstruct the management history of Lake Tegel. Principal component analysis established two main gradients of sediment composition: heavy metals and lithogenic elements. The impact of the management measures was visualized in the lake sediment composition changing from high abundance of heavy metals and reducing redox conditions to less-impacted sediments in recent layers. The clustering techniques suggested heterogeneity among sites within Lake Tegel that probably reflect urban water management measures. The abundance of heavy metals in recent lake sediments of Lake Tegel is similar to a lake with low urban impact and is lower than in Lake Großer Wannsee suggesting that the management measures were successful in the reduction of heavy metals, which are still a threat for surface waters worldwide.},

	abstract = {Thousands of lakes in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing a continuous increase in water temperature and colour. While increasing temperature is an effect of climate change, several factors are suggested to drive the increasing water colour, including climate change, altered land use and reversed acidification. In this mesocosm study, we study the effects on pelagic production and sedimentation of organic carbon from a 3 °C increase in temperature, a doubling of water colour and a combination of increased temperature and water colour. These manipulations correspond to the predicted development in water colour and temperature in northern temperate systems within the life time of the next generation. The water and plankton communities in the mesocosms were taken from an oligohumic and mesotrophic lake, and the increase in water colour was achieved by the additions of water from a humic lake. The experiment ran from early March to late October. In accordance with our predictions and previous cross-system analyses, net carbon production (NCP) and organic carbon sedimentation decreased in response to increasing water colour. At odds with current theory, NCP and sedimentation increased in heated treatments, as not only respiration but also gross production increased in response to temperature. There were no synergistic effects between warming and browning. These results imply that warming may enhance pelagic delivery of organic carbon to sediments. This could potentially offset a reduction in burial efficiency of organic carbon, which has been projected based on a positive relationship between carbon mineralisation in sediments and temperature.},

	abstract = {In multidimensional water quality modelling the spatial and temporal distributions of dissolved substances and suspended particles are simulated in order to account for inhomogeneities in the transport and reactive processes. The exchange processes at the water surface, e.g. photosynthesis and oxygen transfer, and at the water–sediment interface, e.g. erosion, deposition and oxygen transfer, are basically multidimensional. A homogeneous distribution can be expected only if the mixing processes generated by the hydrodynamics occur in a short time period compared with the reaction rates. This article presents sample results of a three-dimensional water quality model that includes the lake hydrodynamics, sedimentation and the proper representation of physical and reactive processes at the bottom and surface boundaries. The goal is to use this insight in order to obtain a better description of water quality with lower-dimensional models using spatial averaging techniques. For this purpose, the program ℡EMAC-3D, which is able to calculate three-dimensional free surface flows and transport, was extended to include reactive processes. Ordinary differential equations remain to be solved following the solution of the non-reactive transport equations using operator-splitting techniques. These are in turn solved using a fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. As the reaction rates are in part considerably long compared with the hydrodynamics, a larger time-step is used for solving the transport equations. The model was applied to a lake in Berlin, Germany, the Großer Müggelsee. Although comparatively shallow, it experiences extensive multidimensional hydrodynamics as a result of wind-induced currents and the Spree River, which flows through it. Numerous water quality measurements undertaken by the Institüt für Gewässerökologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB) demonstrate the influence of the hydrodynamics on the concentration distributions. A comparison between calculations with the spatial average of the 3-D model and directly calculated 0-D model results using the same reactive–kinetic formulations clearly demonstrates that the multidimensional effects, including the current distribution, have a significant effect on the water quality. Therefore, care must be taken to correctly include multidimensional effects for detailed assessment of possible remedial measures to improve the water quality. An averaging technique for including these effects is presented. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {PurposeIn lake restoration, the redox sensitivity of iron (Fe)–phosphorus (P) compounds has been regarded as detrimental for a sustainable increase in sedimentary P retention since developing low redox potentials release Fe-bound P. Thus, Fe salts alone have rarely been used successfully to inactivate sediment P, and there are no studies on the long-term effects of in-lake Fe applications on P retention. Here, we analyzed for how long, and how efficiently, a single and continuous Fe application can affect the P budget of lakes.Materials and methodsTwo aerated lakes in Berlin, Germany were compared: Lake Tegel (TEG) experienced a continuous Fe supply via its tributaries, while Lake Groß-Glienicke (GGS) was treated once with Fe in the winter of 1992/1993. By controlling the operation of aerators, their effectiveness on P exchange at the sediment–water interface (non-aerated vs. aerated) was directly compared in spring and autumn between 2008 and 2010. The amount of P controllable by aeration (P control) was experimentally determined by non-aerated vs. aerated sediment cores (at 10 and 16 °C). Core stratigraphy of Fe was observed by high-resolution μX-ray fluorescence analysis.Results and discussionIn TEG, the mobility of Fe was limited due to its sulfidic fixation, and thus Fe only accumulated slightly at the sediment surface (Fe/P ratio, ∼3). P control corresponded to only 4 \% of the P content of the lake and 18 \% of P loading. Hence, aeration only slightly influenced trophy-relevant epilimnetic P. In GGS, the single Fe application still ensures a high P binding ability of sediment since Fe relocated towards the surface (Fe/P ratio, ∼7). P control corresponded to 38 \% of the P content of the lake and 74 \% of annual P loading. Thus, the P release is not relevant for the P supply to the epilimnion since with the lake’s overturn P is co-precipitated by the hypolimnetically accumulated Fe.ConclusionsWhen external P loading is sufficiently reduced, as in GGS, amendments to Fe precipitants can increase sediment P retention in a redox-dependent manner over the long term. Thus, the redox-dependent mobility of Fe should no longer be regarded as a disadvantage of Fe-containing precipitants. To compensate for co-precipitation and complexation of Fe with sediment organic matter, a high Fe dosage (≥200 g m−2) is needed.},

	abstract = {Climate forecasts project a global increase in extreme weather events, but information on the consequences for ecosystems is scarce. Of particular significance for lakes are severe storms that can influence biogeochemical processes and biological communities by disrupting the vertical thermal structure during periods of stratification. An exceptional storm passing over northern Germany in July 2011 provided an opportunity to assess the consequences and underlying mechanisms of such extreme events on the interplay between the physics and ecological characteristics of a deep, nutrient-poor lake. Wind speeds were among the most extreme on record. A suite of variables measured throughout the event consistently indicates that a cascade of processes pushed the clear-water lake into an exceptionally turbid state. Specifically, thermocline deepening by the storm-entrained cyanobacteria of a deep chlorophyll maximum located at about 8 m depth into the surface mixed layer. Released from light limitation, intense photosynthesis of the cyanobacteria boosted primary production, increased algal biomass, raised the pH and thus induced massive calcite precipitation to a level never observed within three decades of lake monitoring. As a consequence, water transparency dropped from 6.5 to 2.1 m, the minimum on record for 40 years, and the euphotic zone shrank by about 8 m for several weeks. These results show that cyanobacterial blooms not only are promoted by climate warming, but can also be triggered by extreme storms. Clear-water lakes developing a deep chlorophyll maximum appear to be particularly at risk in the future, if such events become more intense or frequent.},

	abstract = {Lakes all around the globe are under severe pressure due to an increasing anthropogenic  impact from a growing population in a more developed world. Accordingly, today, many lakes are  highly eutrophic and suffer from severe blooms of often toxic cyanobacteria and may become even  more eutrophic in the future unless strong lake management actions are taken. Recent research has  further shown that global warming and subsequent changes in water use will further exacerbate the  eutrophication process in lakes. There is therefore a growing demand for lake restoration and  insight into sustainable lake management. The measures to be taken, however, depend on the  climate and other local conditions. This special issue addresses lake restoration and management  with special emphasis on the restoration of eutrophicated lakes within a climate change perspective.  The papers included collectively highlight that the ongoing climate change affects lake water quality  by (1) changes in external and internal nutrient loading; (2) higher frequency of extreme events (such  as hurricanes); (3) temperature‐induced changes in biota, biotic interactions; and (4) water level.  Lower nutrient loading is therefore needed in a future warmer world to achieve the same ecological  state as today. Several papers discuss lake restoration methods within a climate change perspective  and show practical results, notably of various attempts of biomanipulation. Finally, some papers  discuss the effects of other anthropogenic stressors and their interaction with climate.},

To help avoid confusion between these concepts, this paper provides clear definitions of the residence time and the influence time. The similarities and differences between them are illustrated using both a simplified 1D advection–diffusion model and a realistic two-dimensional model of the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). The residence time of a water parcel in a control domain is the time taken by this parcel to leave the control domain for the first time. The influence time is the time required to replace the water in the domain of interest by renewing water. For steady flows, the influence time is numerically identical to the age of the renewing water, but the two timescales differ for unsteady flows. The residence time measures the influence of a hypothetical point discharge on a control domain. In environmental studies, it provides a measure of the effectiveness of hydrodynamic processes at helping a semi-enclosed basin to recover from a local pollution event. The influence time quantifies the local influence of a tracer that would be uniformly distributed in the control domain at the initial time. It is therefore a relevant diagnostic tool in impact studies focusing on the local persistence of a pollution problem initially affecting a large domain.},

The riverine circulation is determined by the inflow rate and by the relative density of incoming water and ambient lake water.

Although the spatial dimension is only one, there are still three velocity components and three “directions.” The gradients along the transverse (virtual) directions are given by the product of the gradient along the real dimension and two arbitrary parameters, α and β, which can be either constant or variable. In general, diﬀerentiation with respect to the yand z-axis is replaced by diﬀerentiation in the x-axis and multiplication by α and β, respectively. This model, for various values of the two parameters, is solved numerically with a pseudo-spectral method and the results are analyzed. The dynamics of the proposed model diﬀers from the well studied dynamics of the Burgers equation. For example, in the case of variable coeﬃcients, the shock formation which characterizes Burger-like solutions is not present in the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Ensemble modelling was used to assess the robustness of projected impacts of pumped-storage (PS) operation and climate change on reservoir ice cover. To this end, three one-dimensional and a two-dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic model were set up. For the latter, the strength of the impacts with increasing distance from the dam was also investigated. Climate change effects were simulated by forcing the models with 150 years of synthetic meteorological time series created with a weather generator based on available air temperature scenarios for Switzerland. Future climate by the end of the 21st century was projected to shorten the ice-covered period by 2 months and decrease ice thicknesses by 13 cm. Under current climate conditions, the ice cover would already be affected by extended PS operation. For example, the average probability of ice coverage on a specific day was projected to decrease by 13\% for current climate and could further be reduced from 45\% to 10\% for future climate. Overall, the results of all models were consistent. Although the number of winters without ice cover was projected to increase for all one-dimensional models, studying individual segments of the two-dimensional model showed that the impact was pronounced for segments close to the PS intake/outlet. In summary, the reservoir's ice cover is expected to partially vanish with higher probability of open water conditions closer to the PS intake/outlet.},

	abstract = {One of the most important and interesting characteristics of a lake is its thermal structure. The heat content of a body of water is of vital importance in limnology. The metabolism, physiology, and behavior of aquatic organisms are related directly to the temperature of the aquatic environment. Extreme temperatures restrict the growth and distribution of plants, animals, and microbes. Because of the high specific heat of water, large volumes of water change temperature relatively slowly. Therefore, large lakes tend to moderate local climates, provide longer growing seasons for aquatic life, and serve as integrated recorders of recent climatic phenomena. For these and other reasons, the thermal structure and heat content of a body of water must be known with some degree of accuracy in limnological studies.Temperature is related to the heat content of a body of water but does not measure it. Tem­perature is a measure of the intensity of heat stored in a volume of water, not a measure of the amount of heat stored. Heat (H) is mea­sured in calories and is a function of the mass (M) of the substance in grams, temperature (t) in °C, and the specific heat (s) in cal/g-°C;† 𝐻=𝑀×𝑡×𝑠H=M×t×s H = M {\textbackslash}times t {\textbackslash}times s A bathtub filled with water at 0.5°C has a much greater heat content than does a glass filled with water at a temperature of 25°C.},

The flux enhancements predicted by Model 1 (Deardorff) for prevailing over-lake lapse conditions were inconsistent with measured changes in lake heat storage. When using the Budyko formulation for sky emissivity, ε, satisfactory energy residuals were obtained by eliminating the lapse enhancement while retaining the suppressive effects of over-lake inversions (Model 2 = modified Deardorff). Here, the best estimate of the 10 m Dalton coefficient was 1.45 × 10−3 (cgs units; neutral profile). However, when the Koberg model for ε was adopted instead, satisfactory energy residuals were obtained only after eliminating all adjustments for non-neutral conditions, and increasing the 10 m Dalton coefficient to approximately 1.55 × 10−3 (Model 3). Models 2 and 3 predicted annual evaporation from Lake Mendota of 71 and 86 cm during 1977 (including approximately 6 cm of sublimation during ice cover), bracketing earlier estimates for this locality (76 cm) based on U.S. Weather Bureau Class A pan data, and consistent with intensive studies of Pretty Lake in northern Indiana. My estimates of the 10 m Dalton coefficient (1.45 × 10−3 to 1.55 × 10−3) also narrowly bracket values for Lake Hefner and Lake Mead (1.49 × 10−3), obtained in studies by the U.S. Geological Survey. Moreover, as in the case of the Will Rogers airport near Lake Hefner, meteorologic data collected at Truax Airfield, Wisconsin, proved adequate for estimating sensible and latent heat transfer over the adjacent lake.},

A water layer in the deep hypolimnion has been shown to contain a climatic memory, which has generally increased since 1981. Walker’s stability analysis has revealed that when at a depth below 90 metres there is a level where 0.07 J m-2 are exceeded, total mixing cannot take place.

The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.
RATIONALE The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).
RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).
CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6223/1259855/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.
The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.
Developments in the planetary boundaries concept provide a framework to support global sustainability.

We identified seasonal patterns of WT variability and showed that WT variability increases with increasing Schmidt stability, decreasing Lake number and decreasing ice cover duration, and is higher near the shore than in open water. We introduced the slope of WT spectra as an indicator for the degree of lake mixing to help explain the identified temporal and spatial scales of WT variability.

The onset and duration of the upwelling events correlated well with the balance between stratification (in terms of Schmidt stability) and wind forcing, as expressed by Lake and Wedderburn numbers. The period of regular upwelling appearances lasted 7–15 days, identified by Schmidt stabilities around 30 J m−2 and Lake numbers between 0 and 1, and resulted in persistent temperature gradients of up to 2°C across the lake surface. Our results suggest that spring upwelling should inevitably take place in all freshwater temperate lakes with mean temperatures crossing the maximum density value of freshwater on annual cycle, whereas duration and intensity of the upwelling would vary depending on lake morphometry and weather conditions. Our results suggest major contribution of upwelling in nutrient supply to the upper waters, oxygenation of the deep water column, and air-lake gas exchange, in particular, the release of the sediment-produced methane into the atmosphere.},

LN is a dimensionless parameter defined as the ratio of the moments about the center ofvolume of the water body, of the stabilizing force ofgravity associated with density stratification to the destabilizing forces supplied by wind, cooling, inflow, outflow, and other artificial mixing devices. To demonstrate the universality ofthis parameter, LNvalues are used to describe the extent ofdeep mixing and are compared with changes in DO concentrations in three reservoirs in Australia and four lakes in the U.S.A., which vary in productivity and mixing regimes. A simple model is developed which relates changes in LNvalues, i.e., the extent of mixing, to changes in near bottom DO concentrations. After calibrating the model for a specific system, it is possible to use real-time LNvalues, calculated using water temperature profiles and surface wind velocities, to estimate changes in DO concentrations (assuming unchanged trophic conditions).},

	abstract = {Values of whole-lake standard energy parameters (heat content, thermal stability and Birge's work of the wind) for ten dystrophic standing waters from western Tasmania were lower than expected for lakes of their depth and area. Although controlled principally by morphometric factors, the degree of shelter from wind and the extent of each lake's dystrophy also had considerable effects. These factors allowed only surface waters to contribute to the annual heat exchange cycle, thereby reducing the magnitude of each lake's heat budgets and influencing stability and wind work values. The lakes show considerable short- and long-term fluctuations in heat content, stability and wind work values in response to the capricious maritime meteorological conditions of the area. However, long periods between successive samplings may have caused some underestimation of the ranges of these three parameters. Despite this, the study reveals that these standard energy parameters are effective in describing the annual energy input and resistance to wind-induced mixing of these dystrophic Tasmanian lakes.},

It is found that in the unstable marine surface layer, ζ = C Rib(1 + Rib/Ribc)−1, where the numerical coefficient C and the saturation Richardson number Ribc are analytical functions of the standard bulk exchange coefficients. For measurements at a height of 10–15 m, C is about 10 and Ribc is about −4.5. Their values are insensitive to variations of Rib and ζ over three decades. Thus, a simple dependence between ζ and Rib has a much wider range of applicability than previously believed. The authors show that this behavior is the result of the effects of “gustiness” driven by boundary layer–scale convective eddies. The derived relationship can be used as a first guess for ζ in bulk flux routines and reduces or eliminates the need for lengthy iterative solutions. Using this approximation yields errors in the latent heat flux of a few watts per square meter, compared to the full iterative solution.},

	abstract = {Hutchinson and Löffler's (1956) classification of lakes based on the seasonal thermal mixing regime has become a cornerstone of any analysis of lakes as elements of the earth surface. Until now however the lake classification has lacked a physically sound quantitative criterion distinguishing between two fundamental lake types: thermally stratified during a large portion of the year (mono- and dimictic) and predominantly mixed to the bottom (polymictic). Using the mechanistic balance between potential and kinetic energy we review the different formulations of the Richardson number to derive a generalized scaling for seasonal stratification in a closed lake basin. The scaling parameter is the critical mean basin depth, Hcrit, that delineates lakes that mix regularly from those that stratify seasonally based on lake water transparency, lake length, and an annual mean estimate for the Monin-Obukhov length. We validate the scaling on available data of lakes worldwide using logistic regression. The scaling criterion consistently described the mixing regime significantly better than either the conventional unbounded basin scaling or a simple depth threshold. Thus, the generalized scaling is universal for freshwater lakes and allows the seasonal mixing regime to be estimated without numerically solving the heat transport equations.},

The ability to model lake-ice freeze-up, break-up, total ice thickness and ice type offers the potential to describe the effects of climate change in these regions. Model output is validated against lake-ice observations made during the winter of 1992–93 in Glacier National Park, Montana. U.S.A. The model is driven with observed daily atmospheric forcing of precipitation, wind speed and air temperature. In addition to simulating complete energy-balance components over the annual cycle, model output includes ice freeze-up and break-up dates, and the end-of-season clear ice, snow-ice and total ice depths for two nearby lakes in Glacier National Park, each in a different topographic setting. Modeled ice features are found to agree closely with the lake-ice observations.
Model simulations illustrate the key role that the wind component of the local climatic regime plays on the growth and decay of lake ice. The wind speed affects both the surface temperature and the accumulation of snow on the lake-ice surface. Higher snow accumulations on the lake ice depress the ice surface below the water line, causing the snow to become saturated and leading to the formation of snow-ice deposits. In regions having higher wind speeds, significantly less snow accumulates on the lake-ice surface, thus limiting snow-ice formation. The ice produced by these two different mechanisms has distinctly different optical and radiative properties, and affects the monitoring of frozen lakes using remote-sensing techniques.},

	abstract = {Lakes are active processors of organic carbon (OC) and play important roles in landscape and global carbon cycling. Allochthonous OC loads from the landscape, along with autochthonous OC loads from primary production, are mineralized in lakes, buried in lake sediments, and exported via surface or groundwater outflows. Although these processes provide a basis for a conceptual understanding of lake OC budgets, few studies have integrated these fluxes under a dynamic modeling framework to examine their interactions and relative magnitudes. We developed a simple, dynamic mass balance model for OC, and applied the model to a set of five lakes. We examined the relative magnitudes of OC fluxes and found that long-term ({\textgreater}10 year) lake OC dynamics were predominantly driven by allochthonous loads in four of the five lakes, underscoring the importance of terrestrially-derived OC in northern lake ecosystems. Our model highlighted seasonal patterns in lake OC budgets, with increasing water temperatures and lake productivity throughout the growing season corresponding to a transition from burial- to respiration-dominated OC fates. Ratios of respiration to burial, however, were also mediated by the source (autochthonous vs. allochthonous) of total OC loads. Autochthonous OC is more readily respired and may therefore proportionally reduce burial under a warming climate, but allochthonous OC may increase burial due to changes in precipitation. The ratios of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs and respiration to burial demonstrate the importance of dynamic models for examining both the seasonal and inter-annual roles of lakes in landscape and global carbon cycling, particularly in a global change context. Finally, we highlighted critical data needs, which include surface water DOC observations in paired tributary and lake systems, measurements of OC burial rates, groundwater input volume and DOC, and budgets of particulate OC.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThermal stratification in reservoirs is a significant factor affecting water quality, and can be strongly influenced by climate change and operational strategies. Reservoirs in the temperate zone react most sensitively to climate warming during winter as ice cover and inversed stratification are about to disappear in a warmer world. In this study, two well-established hydrodynamic models, the one-dimensional General Lake Model (GLM) and the two-dimensional CE-QUAL-W2 (W2), were used to investigate the response of winter inversed stratification in the Rappbode Reservoir to future climate warming, combined with different water withdrawal elevations.ResultsUnder increased air temperature, the duration of inversed stratification is reduced and the inversion phenomenon will entirely disappear under current management if the air temperature is increased high enough (more than 4.5 K) in the future. Under strong climate warming, the Rappbode Reservoir will therefore change from a dimictic to a monomictic mixing type. Changing the reservoir management from deep withdrawal (e.g., below 350 m a.s.l.) to shallow withdrawal elevations (e.g., above 390 m a.s.l.) reduces internal heat energy stored in the reservoir in summer and prolongs the inversed stratification period in winter. This strategy can retain the dimictic behavior even under strong warming.ConclusionsOur study indicates that adjusting the withdrawal elevation is an effective management instrument to control the winter conditions and can, in fact, mitigate climate warming effects on winter hydrodynamics by stabilizing the dimictic mixing type.},

A coupled ecological and hydrodynamic model (Dynamic Reservoir Model (DYRESM)–Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM)) was validated with an extensive field data set to simulate the seasonal dynamics of nutrients, three phytoplankton groups and three zooplankton groups. Parameterization of the model was conducted using field, experimental and literature studies. Sensitivity of simulated output was tested over the full parameter space and established that the most sensitive parameters were related to zooplankton grazing rates, temperature responses and food limitation. The simulated results predict that, on average, 51\% of the carbon from phytoplankton photosynthesis is consumed by zooplankton. Excretion of dissolved nutrients by zooplankton accounts for 3–46 and 5–58\% of phytoplankton uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen, respectively. Comparison of nutrient fluxes attributable to zooplankton with nutrient loads from inflows and release from bottom sediments shows that the relative contribution by zooplankton to inorganic nutrients in the photic zone varies seasonally in response to the annual hydrodynamic cycle of stratification and mixing. As a percent of total dissolved organic sources relative contributions by zooplankton excretion are highest (62\%) during periods of stratification and when inflow nutrient loads are low, and lowest (2\%) during the breakdown of stratification and when inflow loads are high. The results illustrate the potential of a lake ecosystem model to extract useful process information to complement field data collection and address questions related to the role of zooplankton in nutrient cycles.},

The benefit of this data platform is here practically illustrated with two examples. First we show that the output data allows for assessing the long term effects of past climate change on the thermal structure of a lake. In the second case, we demonstrate how the data platform can be used to study and compare the role of episodic strong wind events for different lakes on a regional scale and especially how they temporary destabilize their thermal structure.

Whereas the classical cooling-induced and shear-induced convections are well-known phenomena due to their dominant roles in ocean basins, other convective processes are specific to lakes and often overlooked, for example, sidearm, under-ice, and double-diffusive convection or thermobaric instability and bioconvection.

The radon flux F from the bottom is calculated from 226Ra in the sediments and corrected for depth variation of porosity and radium activity. In Baldeggersee (Switzerland), F is 390 ± 70 dpm·m‒2·d‒1. Radium activities in the sediments are 0.7 ± 0.2 dpm·g‒1 dry mass, similar to those in other Swiss lakes and in coastal areas of the ocean but 20–50 times smaller than in the deep Pacific. Horizontal diffusivity in the hypolimnion decreases from June (5,000 m2·d‒1) to October (1,000 m2·d‒1); vertical diffusivity is between 1 and 10 m2·d‒1, roughly 10 times larger than values calculated from temperature in the upper hypolimnion. Vertical buoyancy flux is between 10‒11 and 10‒10 m2·s‒3, i.e. between values for the deep ocean and the small ELA lakes in Canada. The large Kz and the transient, often irregular shape of the radon profiles are the result of horizontal bottom currents previously measured by other methods.},

Oxygen depletion processes in lakes are still not completely understood and a variety of models have been proposed based on limited field observations. Here, we present field measurements of oxygen depletion processes in a deep lake, Lake Geneva (Switzerland). The aim of this study was to quantify three basic processes controlling hypolimnetic oxygen depletion and their relative contribution to the total oxygen depletion (TOD) rate. Sediment oxygen uptake (SOU) and the flux of reduced substances were estimated based on oxygen microprofile measurements and sediment core data of reduced substances. Acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements and hydrodynamic modeling were used to ensure that SOU was measured under typical hydrodynamic conditions. Comparison with long-term monitoring data allowed for an estimate of the relative importance of SOU and water column mineralization (WCM). Results show a decrease in both SOU and WCM down to mid-depth which could not be explained by changes in hydrodynamic conditions or temperature. Below mid-depth, TOD increased due to an enhanced sediment area to water volume ratio (α). This vertical pattern of oxygen depletion is driven by (1) lake morphometry paired with increasing α, and (2) decreasing organic matter mineralization in the water column with depth. The findings are explained by a model which separates the oxygen depletion into an exponentially decreasing component, representing the fast-decaying fraction of the organic matter, and a constant background component.},

	abstract = {Oxygen depletion (temporal or permanent) in freshwater ecosystems is a widespread and globally important environmental problem. However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picos de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013–2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification. Global warming may indirectly increase anoxia in many other mountain lakes in the near future.},

The investigation shows: 1. Vertical mixing coefficients below 25 m are small. Consequently the vertical concentration distribution of sediment emanating species in the deep hypolimnion is controlled by the bottom topography. 2. Renewal of deep hypolimnic water is significant even during stratification. 3. Weakly damped internal waves characterize the internal dynamics during stratification. 4. Horizontal bottom currents play an important role in the hypolimnion mixing and can be correlated to internal waves during stratification.},

The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

VOD values increased as temperature and phosphorus retention increased. Rates were inversely proportional to the ratio of the volume of the stratum divided by the area of sediments that are contiguous to the stratum. The statistical model was tested by measuring VOD values in an independent group of 12 lakes. Predictions agreed well with the measured values. An analysis of the combined data explained 91\% of the variance in VOD values. The regression correctly predicted the vertical variation in VOD values in lakes that exhibited negative heterograde, orthograde, and clinograde oxygen profiles. After further testing, this model should provide a method of predicting changes in oxygen concentrations in lakes that are subject to perturbations such as changes in temperature or nutrient loading.},

Dynamic or mechanistic models and empirical or statistical methods have been used to integrate the physical processes in lakes enabling the response of the thermal structure to changes in air temperature to be determined. Water temperature records for Lake Mendota, WI., are possibly the most extensive for any dimictic lake in the world and allowed both approaches to be used. Results from both techniques suggest the mixed layer temperature increases with increasing air temperature. Results from the empirical approach suggested epilimnion temperatures increase 0.5 to 1.0°C per 1.0°C increase in air temperature compared to 0.4 to 0.85°C estimated from a dynamical model (DYRESM). Increased air temperatures are related to significant warming in deep water temperatures in the absence of stratification; however, mid summer hypolimnion temperatures are expected to change very little or increase only slightly in response to climatic warming. Both approaches suggest increases in air temperatures increase the length of summer stratification; results from the dynamic model suggest an increase of approximately 5 days per 1°C increase in air temperature. Longer stratification is reflected in shallower late summer thermocline depths. With these quantitative relationships and forecast increases in air temperature for the 2 × CO2 climatic scenario (Greenhouse Effect) from three General Circulation Models, projections are made describing the changes in the future mean thermal structure of moderate to large sized lakes.},

	abstract = {The increase in strength and duration of summer stratification in temperate lakes is a well-described sentinel of climatic change reported in numerous lake studies. The definitions of the onset of thermal stratification in early spring and its breakup during the autumn overturn are usually binary thresholds chosen on a subjective basis. However, the transition phases between mixing and stagnation (start of summer stratification) and between stagnation and mixing (end of summer stratification) are continuous processes. Therefore, the time limits of the stratified period are definition-dependent, which complicates comparison of results from different studies. An experimental determination of the duration of summ­ er stratification needs unified criteria to decide when stratification is established and when it terminates. We demonstrate that the termination of the stratified period (start of autumn mixing) can be detected with sufficient accuracy from near bottom temperature records at the deepest point of the lake. Nevertheless, it takes days after this moment until the whole water column is mixed completely and a stability threshold is required for the end of the stratified period. To define the beginning of the stratified period, thresholds for different stability indices were suggested previously. Although the threshold choice influences the estimated duration of stratification each year, it appears not to significantly affect the long-term trends of stratification. More important than the selection of stability thresholds is therefore the quality of observational data used for analysis. Using measured data from two dimictic Lakes in Northern Germany we show that the estimation of the stratification length depends strongly on the temporal resolution of the measurements. For comparative studies which aim to verify a shift in future temperate lake stratification experimentally, we suggest (i) to use data from high-resolution water temperature probes (discarding completely data sets with weekly, biweekly or sparser sampling period), (ii) to use a consistent stability threshold (e.g. a fixed value of Schmidt stability) to derive the duration of the stratified period uniformly, and (iii) to apply standardized algorithms in large intercomparison studies to determine indices of stratification.},

Oxygenation increased JO2 in both lakes by increasing the bulk oxygen concentration, which in turn steepens the diffusive gradient across the diffusive boundary layer. At high flow rates, the diffusive boundary layer thickness decreased as well. A transect along one of the lakes showed JO2 to be spatially quite variable, with near-field and far-field JO2 differing by a factor of 4. Using these in situ measurements, physical models of interfacial flux were compared to microprofile-derived JO2 to determine which models adequately predict JO2 in oxygenated lakes. Models based on friction velocity, turbulence dissipation rate, and the integral scale of turbulence agreed with microprofile-derived JO2 in both lakes. These models could potentially be used to predict oxygenation-induced oxygen flux and improve oxygenation system design methods for a broad range of reservoir systems.},

At high flow rates, the diffusive boundary layer thickness decreased as well. A transect along one of the lakes showed J(O2) to be spatially quite variable, with near-field and far-field J(O2) differing by a factor of 4. Using these in situ measurements, physical models of interfacial flux were compared to microprofile-derived J(O2) to determine which models adequately predict J(O2) in oxygenated lakes. Models based on friction velocity, turbulence dissipation rate, and the integral scale of turbulence agreed with microprofile-derived J(O2) in both lakes. These models could potentially be used to predict oxygenation-induced oxygen flux and improve oxygenation system design methods for a broad range of reservoir systems.},

	abstract = {Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion has been recognized as a problem in the central basin of Lake Erie since the 1970s. However, recent expansion in distribution of the depletion after several years of low depletion rates in the 1990s has led investigators to explore the factors that influence the extent of the depletion. We have investigated the vertical oxygen budget in the central basin, which is influenced by the following factors: 1) vertical mixing; 2) exchange across the air-water interface; 3) photosynthesis; 4) respiration of plankton; and 5) sediment oxygen demand. We tested the importance of these factors using a 1-D vertical oxygen budget and transport simulations through sensitivity analysis and by estimating vertical mixing parameters using a temperature gradient microprofiler. Epilimnetic factors were found to be robust and the present monitoring efforts are sufficient; while epilimnetic production is ultimately the source of the hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, epilimnetic factors do not directly influence on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. However, hypolimnetic depletion was sensitive to sediment oxygen demand and hypolimnion respiration, which are the results of primary production in the epilimnion, and hypolimnetic mixing, which is not related to eutrophication. These parameters, especially the physical mixing measurements, and their links with eutrophication and primary production require greater monitoring and analysis because of their influence on the expansion of oxygen depletion in the central basin of Lake Erie.},

This lake supplies approximately four million people with drinking water and has undergone strong re-oligotrophication over the past decades. We calculated depth-specific annual oxygen depletion rates (ODRs) during the period of stratification and found that 50\% of the observed variability in ODR was already explained by a simple separation into a sediment- and volume-related oxygen consumption. Adding a linear factor for water depth further improved the model indicating that oxygen depletion increased substantially along the depth. Two other factors turned out to significantly influence ODR: total phosphorus as a proxy for the lake’s trophic state and mean oxygen concentration in the respective depth layer. Our analysis points to the importance of nutrient reductions as effective management measures to improve and protect the oxygen status of such large and deep lakes.},

	abstract = {Although few reports have described long-term continuous anoxia in aquatic systems, Lake Ikeda in Japan experienced such conditions in the hypolimnion from 1990 to 2010. The present study aimed to assess temporal fluctuations in the lake's thermal stability from 1978 to 2011 to understand the influence of regional climate change on hypolimnetic anoxia in this lake. Because complete vertical mixing, which supplies dissolved oxygen (DO) to the hypolimnion, potentially occurs on February, we calculated the Schmidt stability index (S) in February and compared it with hypolimnetic DO dynamics. Vertical water temperature profiles were calculated using a one-dimensional model, and calculated temperatures and meteorological data were used to analyse annual fluctuations in water temperatures, thermocline depth, meteorological variables and S. We estimated that mean annual air and volume-weighted water temperatures increased by 0.028 and 0.033 °C year−1, respectively, from 1978 to 2011. Between 1986 and 1990, S and water temperature increased abruptly, probably due to a large upwards trend in air temperature (+0.239 °C year−1). We hypothesize that a mixing regime that lacked overturn took effect at this time and that this regime lasted until 2011, when S was particularly small. These results demonstrate that abrupt climate warming in the late 1980s likely triggered the termination of complete mixing and caused the 21-year period of successive anoxia in Lake Ikeda. We conclude that the lake response to a rapid shift in regional climate conditions was a key factor in changing the hypolimnetic water environment and that thermal stability in winter is a critical environmental factor controlling the mixing regime and anoxic conditions in deep lakes.

	abstract = {Oxygen depletion (temporal or permanent) in freshwater ecosystems is a widespread and globally important environmental problem. However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picos de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013–2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification. Global warming may indirectly increase anoxia in many other mountain lakes in the near future.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations in lakes and to track changes in concentrations over time in response to known environmental stressors is critical for effective lake management. The background concentrations of deepwater oxygen, in particular, provide important management benchmarks for assessing the impact of current and future shoreline residential development on water quality. Background can be defined as the conditions that exist in the absence of, or prior to, human influence. We compare 2 models commonly used to predict end-of-summer, volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (VWHO) concentrations in Canadian Shield lakes. The paleoecological and empirical models are evaluated in their ability to predict present-day VWHO concentrations, and then compared in their predictions of background VWHO concentrations and in predictions of changes in VWHO from background to present-day conditions. The predictive power of the 59-lake paleoecological model (jackknifed r2 = 0.51, RMSEP = 2.18 mg/L) is comparable to other models that have used chironomids to predict the degree of hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes but is lower than that produced by the empirical modelling approach (r2 = 0.87, SE = 1.04 mg/L). However, this discrepancy may be offset by the enhanced realism of the paleoecological model, including its ability to predict declines in VWHO over time. The combined use of the paleoecological and empirical modelling approaches may allow lake managers to examine changes in deepwater oxygen concentrations in response to a single “targeted” stressor (e.g., residential shoreline development) and to multiple environmental stressors (e.g., climate change, hydrological management).},

The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (JV) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O2 m−3 d−1 in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (JA) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 6 0.0150 g O2 m−2 whole sediment d−1. We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field JA, the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by JV and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, α(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core JA values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O2 m−3 whole sediment d−1. Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant JA and with a JV value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.},

There are no easy ways to quantify exeedences of important thresholds of DO in lakes, except the complete lack of DO, quantified as an annual or seasonal anoxic factor (Nürnberg 1995a, b). Here an analogous concept, the “Hypoxic Factor” (HF) is introduced. According to specific water quality standards, certain levels of oxygen depletion can be quantified, e.g., DO concentrations below 5 mg L−1 or 6.5 mg L−1. The HF is computed from the duration and extent of hypoxia by using DO profiles and hypsographic data. It is expressed in such a way that a value of 365 d yr−1 would mean the whole lake has a DO concentration below the specified level at all times. The application to a TMDL project, where DO standards are to be employed in a large Snake River reservoir, demonstrates the potential usefulness of HF. This quantification of hypoxia allows the testing of hypotheses, e.g., the dependency of hypoxia on stage height, flow and nutrients. Significant relationships were found between annual expressions of hypoxia and hydrological variables (seasonal flows, water retention time) and a climatic index.},

Assessments of oxygen resources are based on DO profiles of 1 m resolution conducted hourly to weekly during April-October. Closure of an industry that operated on the lake's shore until 1986 resulted in an abrupt decrease in primary production and organic carbon deposition and marked changes in hypolimnetic and epilimnetic DO regimes. The hypolimnetic DO response was gradual, reflecting the influence of sediment feedback. The onset of complete hypolimnetic anoxia, which occurred by early June through the 1980s, took place approximately one month later over 1997–2002. The anoxic factor decreased significantly over the study interval, from 97±5 d to 67±2 d. Epilimnetic DO concentrations responded rapidly to the abrupt change in lake metabolism. Before closure of the industry, 41\% of the April to mid-September DO observations deviated from saturation concentrations by {\textgreater}30\%. In the years immediately following industry closure, this degree of disequilibrium occurred in 23\% of DO observations. Percent saturation values during fall turnover increased gradually during the study, from 49±2 to 65±2. DO concentrations in the lake's upper waters have been subject to substantial diel fluctuations ({\textgreater}4 mg/L), with daily minima and maxima generally occurring at approximately 7:00 and 16:00, respectively. Measurements made at 11:00 and 22:00 were most likely to be representative of daily average conditions. Diel variations and sampling frequency were demonstrated to be important issues for the evaluation of status with respect to water quality standards for DO. Levels of DO in the lake's upper waters have been positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations (r = 0.52). Despite marked improvements in DO resources, the lake continues to lack cool, well-oxygenated waters during summer necessary to support coldwater fish species.},

	abstract = {The dissolved oxygen concentrations in Darwin River Reservoir (DRR) and Manton River Reservoir (MRR), both located in the wet/dry tropics of Australia, were investigated over an 8-year period. Average oxygen concentrations were lower in MRR than in DRR, indicating the dominance of consumptive processes not compensated by photosynthetic production of oxygen, despite MRR’s higher chlorophyll a concentration. With the onset of thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion of each reservoir was depleted at average rates of 3.4–7.1 mg L−1 month−1. These are higher than rates reported for temperate water-bodies (0.10–3.0 mg L−1 month−1). This was ascribed primarily to the effect of temperature on microbial metabolism, while the influence of the reservoirs’ high epilimnion to hypolimnion volumetric ratios (approximately 10:1) and reservoir trophic state were considered secondary. Due to the temperature dependence of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, the trophic classification of lakes based on hypolimnetic deoxygenation and anoxia is not globally applicable, but is applicable to water-bodies of similar hypolimnetic temperatures, especially when morphometric influences are also taken into account. Both reservoirs experienced long periods of anoxia (average: 9 months in MRR, 5 months in DRR). In DRR, the extent of hypolimnetic anoxia was related to hypolimnion volume. Hypolimnetic anoxia in the reservoirs, when quantified by the anoxic factor (AF; number of days that a sediment area, equal to the whole-lake surface area, is overlain by anoxic waters), was high compared with similar water-bodies in North America, providing quantitative evidence that anoxia in more prevalent in tropical reservoirs. Ammonia, iron and manganese accumulated in the hypolimnion of both DRR and MRR, with concentrations decreasing exponentially from the sediments to the oxycline. Sediment phosphorus release was detected in MRR, but not detected in DRR, despite the reservoir’s long periods of hypolimnetic anoxia. The high water temperatures and lengthy periods of hypolimnetic anoxia of the reservoirs provided a favourable environment for anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria.},

Most model inputs, and many of the kinetic coefficients, were developed through a program of field monitoring and field and laboratory experimentation. The model was calibrated and verified using data collected in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Severe dissolved oxygen depletion is observed in the hypolimnion (lower mixed layer; LML) of Onondaga Lake during summer stratification. SOD and water column oxidation of reduced species diffusing from the sediment are together responsible for {\textgreater}70\% of the summer depletion; CBOD, NBOD and algal respiration account for the balance. DO depletion occurs in the epilimnion (upper mixed layer; UML) in the fall. Oxidation of reduced species entrained from the LML is responsible for about 30\% of the fall depletion, with algal respiration and mass transport to the LML accounting for about 25\% each; CBOD and NBOD are minor sinks.

The vertical transport of DO represented from 0 to 30\% of VHODobs, while adjustments for interannual differences in hypolimnetic temperature were less important, ranging from −11 to 9\% of VHODobs. 4. The mean wind speed during May made the strongest significant contribution to the variation in VHODobs. VHODobs adjusted for the vertical transport of DO and hypolimnetic temperature differences, VHODadj, was significantly related to the upper mixed layer Chl a concentration during spring. 5. Hypolimnetic anoxia (HA) ranged from 27 to 168 days per year and increased significantly over time, which undoubtedly had negative ecological consequences for the lake. 6. In similar small temperate lakes, the negative effects of eutrophication on hypolimnetic DO are likely to be exacerbated by changes in lake thermal structure brought about by a warming climate, which may undermine management efforts to alleviate the effects of anthropogenic eutrophication.},

The geometric means of summer surface average nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) concentration, phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll concentration), and hypolimnetic anoxia (anoxic factor) were significantly higher in coloured than in clear lakes. The regressions of colour or DOC on these trophic state variables were positive and significant throughout a range of three orders of magnitude. Phytoplankton or primary productivity was higher in coloured lakes, when expressed per volume of epilimnion. Annual integral primary productivity expressed on an areal basis was smaller in coloured lakes, probably a reflection of shallower phototrophic depths in these lakes. There is evidence that annual integral bacteria productivity is much higher in coloured lakes for two reasons: first, epilimnetic bacteria production was ca. four times higher in coloured lakes, second, other studies have shown that hypolimnetic bacteria production is commonly higher than epilimnetic production, especially in anoxic hypolimnia that are frequent in coloured lakes. All volumetrically expressed variables indicated higher productivity in coloured lakes. In addition, high bacteria productivity reflects a different food chain involving mixotrophs, possibly compensating for low light conditions. Our analyses indicate that primary and secondary productivity is as high as or higher than in clear lakes.},

Because the contributions of each inflow have not yet been quantified and because the lake features complex bathymetry and numerous islands, a hydrodynamic circulation model with high spatial resolution and dynamic wind forcing is useful. We applied the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model to separate the influences of wind and river discharge on the currents and mass transport in Lake Tegel. For model validation, we compared the simulation results with 1 year of electrical conductivity data, which was used as a conservative tracer to distinguish between water from the River Havel and water supplied by a smaller second inflow. Calculation of currents alone is insufficient to investigate water exchanges between rivers and lakes, especially when several islands create multiple pathways for river intrusion. Therefore, mass transport simulations are applied. Our calculations based on archetypical scenarios indicate that the proportion of (polluted) water from the River Havel in the main basin of Lake Tegel fluctuates with river discharge and wind, which either amplify or neutralize each other.},

The program was created for the analysis of high-frequency data collected from instrumented lake buoys, in support of the emerging field of aquatic sensor network science. Available outputs for the Lake Analyzer program are: water temperature (error-checked and/or down-sampled), wind speed (error-checked and/or down-sampled), metalimnion extent (top and bottom), thermocline depth, friction velocity, Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, mode-1 vertical seiche period, and Brunt-Väisälä buoyancy frequency. Secondary outputs for several of these indices delineate the parent thermocline depth (seasonal thermocline) from the shallower secondary or diurnal thermocline. Lake Analyzer provides a program suite and best practices for the comparison of mixing and stratification indices in lakes across gradients of climate, hydro-physiography, and time, and enables a more detailed understanding of the resulting biogeochemical transformations at different spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Oxygen concentration is both an indicator and driver of water quality in lakes. Decreases in oxygen concentration leads to altered ecosystem function as well as harmful consequences for aquatic biota, such as fishes. The responses of oxygen dynamics in lakes to climate-related drivers, such as temperature and wind speed, are well documented for lake surface waters. However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.},

	abstract = {Two powerful formulas have been available to scientists for more than two centuries: Newton's second law, providing a foundation for classical physics, and Bayes's theorem, prescribing probabilistic learning about unknown quantities based on observations. For the most part the use of these formulas has been separated, with Newton being the more dominant in geophysics. This separation is arguably surprising since numerous sources of uncertainty arise in the application of classical physics in complex situations. One explanation for the separation is the difficulty in implementing Bayesian analysis in complex settings. However, recent advances in both modeling strategies and computational tools have contributed to a significant change in the scope and feasibility of Bayesian analysis. This paradigm provides opportunities for the combination of physical reasoning and observational data in a coherent analysis framework but in a fashion which manages the uncertainties in both information sources. A key to the modeling is the hierarchical viewpoint, in which separate statistical models are developed for the process variables studied and for the observations conditional on those variables. Modeling process variables in this way enables the incorporation of physics across a spectrum of levels of intensity, ranging from a qualitative use of physical reasoning to a strong reliance on numerical models. Selected examples from this spectrum are reviewed. So far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain. And so far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.Albert Einstein (1921)},

Coupled to GOTM is a biological model that includes phytoplankton, detritus, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, chlorophyll and oxygen. We performed model ensemble runs by introducing variations in the biological parameters, each of which was assigned a probability distribution. We compare and contrast here 2 sequential data assimilation methods: the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and sequential importance resampling (SIR). We assimilated different types of BATS observations, including particulate organic nitrogen, nitrate+nitrite, chlorophyll a and oxygen for the 2-year period from January 1990 to December 1991, and quantified the impact of the data assimilation on the model's predictive skill. By applying a cross-validation to the data-assimilative and deterministic simulations we found that the predictive skill was improved for 2-week forecasts. In our experiments the EnKF, which exhibited a stronger effect on the ensemble during the assimilation step, showed slightly higher improvements in the predictive skill than the SIR, which preserves dynamical model consistency in our implementation. Our numerical experiments show that statistical properties stabilize for ensemble sizes of 20 or greater with little improvement for larger ensembles.},

It is concluded that the terrestrial organic matter plays an important role in inﬂuencing interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Based on the ﬂuctuations of lake ecosystem, we further develop a stochastically perturbed model. Theoretic analysis implies that the stochastic model exists a stationary distribution which is ergodic.

We explore and demonstrate the ideas in the context of a simple nonlinear marine biogeochemical model. A novel approach is proposed to the formulation of the stochastic process model, in which ecophysiological properties of plankton communities are represented by autoregressive stochastic processes.

	abstract = {abstract: Spatial heterogeneity in organism and resource distributions can generate temporal heterogeneity in resource access for simple organisms like phytoplankton. The role of temporal heterogeneity as a structuring force for simple communities is investigated via models of phytoplankton with contrasting life histories competing for a single fluctuating resource. A stochastic model in which environmental and demographic stochasticity are treated separately is compared with a model with deterministic resource variation to assess the importance of stochasticity. When compared with the deterministic model, the stochastic model allows for coexistence over a wider range of parameter values (or life‐history types). The model suggests that demographic stochasticity alone is far more important in increasing the possibility of coexistence than environmental stochasticity alone. However, the combined effects of both types of stochasticity produce the largest likelihood of coexistence. Finally, the influence of relative nutrient levels and nutrient pulse frequency on these results is addressed. We relate our findings to variable environment theory with evidence for both relative nonlinearity and the storage effect acting in this model. We show for the first time that temporal dynamics generated by demographic stochasticity may operate like the storage effect at particular spatial scales.},

However, ecosystem models often fail to agree with observations. This failure can be due to inadequacies in the data and/or inadequacies in the model formulation and parameterization. Here we parameterize and optimize a two-phytoplankton functional type model of phytoplankton growth rate and chlorophyll/carbon (Chl:C) ratio using data from the Lagrangian field measurements conducted during process cruises of the Long-Term Ecosystem Research–California Current Ecosystem (CCE) program. We parameterize the model based on a small coastal subset of the data and then extend and test it with the full data set, including data from offshore regions. The CCE process studies were focused on quantifying the size-resolved planktonic growth, grazing, production, and export rates while following water parcels. The resulting data therefore provided strong constraints for the model we employed. The modeled growth rates and Chl:C ratios were in good agreement with observations. Our results indicate that the model can accurately predict Chl:C ratios, biomasses, and growth rates of dominant functional types using relatively easily measured environmental variables (temperature, nutrients, and bulk chlorophyll). The model also accurately reproduces the subsurface maxima of growth rates, the spatial separation of carbon and chlorophyll maxima, and many other observations in the California Current coastal and pelagic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The principle of “competitive exclusion” predicts that no two species can occupy the same ecological niche at the same time and place (Hardin, 1960). Hutchinson (1953, 1961) suggested that the vast diversity of phytoplankton observed in many aquatic environments presents an apparent contradiction to this principle. Since all phytoplankton compete for the same basic resources, and since the euphotic zones of most natural waters are relatively homogeneous, such coexisting plankters appear to be simultaneously occupying the same niche. In this paper we present simulation results from a mathematical model wherein we examine the hypothesis that physical turbulence in an aquatic system can mollify interactive pressures between plankton populations and allow coexistence of species competing for the same resources. Using Bella's (1972) highly simplified model as a point of departure, we develop a new model, explicitly incorporating gross physiological mechanisms, to investigate the effects of both advective and turbulent components of water movement on the growth of three competing phytoplankton species. We observed that, in the absence of water motion, no two species were able to coexist, while under the hypothetical conditions of advection without turbulence (laminar flow), just two species were able to occur contemporaneously. Coexistence of all three species was achieved only with the addition of a random turbulent component to the model's hydrodynamic function. Moreover, this general coexistence was observed only when the major turbulent frequency approached the turnover rate of phytoplankton populations. We suggest that there is a limited region of periodicities and magnitudes for hydrodynamic energy in which phytoplankton can coexist, and that most natural aquatic environments fall within this region. We further speculate that, in general, the coupling of physical and biological processes in nature may be influenced by the relative frequency characteristics of those processes.},

Singular-spectrum analysis (SSA) and the multi-taper method (MTM) of spectral analysis revealed a nonlinear trend and quasi-periodic oscillations. Analysis of the linearly detrended series showed significant frequencies ranging from quasi biennial to {\textgreater}100 years. The interannual and interdecadal signals detected are within the range of periodicity of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) modes of variability. A smoothing procedure was used to separate low frequencies, or trend, and higher frequencies. Four reconstructed components of the low-pass-filtered time series were sufficient to explain 95\% of the filtered series variance. The reconstruction showed signals with periods longer than 20 years that could be associated with the PDO. The series showed a relatively constant trend between approximately 1895 and 1965, and a steep declining trend in the last 40 years. Twenty four reconstructed components of the high-frequency residuals were required to explain 90\% of the variance in the residual series. The reconstruction showed interdecadal signals that could be associated with the PDO and signals with periods between two and seven years that could be associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Results of a coherence analysis showed that ice-cover duration is significantly correlated with the PDO for periods longer than about 20 years, and with the SOI for periods between two and seven years. The results suggest a relationship between the decreasing ice duration since about 1970 and the accompanying increase in Northern Hemisphere mean annual surface temperature. This interpretation agrees with previous descriptions of observed historic changes that appear to be related to anthropogenic activity.},

In eutrophic stratified lakes, seasonal entrainment can be responsible for delayed recovery following a decrease in external phosphorus load. We compared seasonal estimates of entrainment derived from single- and multilocation thermocline migration approaches. Entrainment estimates from these methods were similar. A sampling approach based on a single centralized location produced whole-lake entrainment estimates in general agreement with the mean value from the multilocation approach (the single-location approach reasonably reproduced patterns at a weekly and seasonal time scale). In this study, it was not essential to account for spatial variation in estimating annual rates of entrainment. We also estimated entrainment based on a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic model over a short period of significant thermocline migration. The 3-D model was most useful in exposing spatial and temporal variation in temperature and phosphorus profiles that are otherwise difficult to observe. Spatial variation in phosphorus profiles was associated with upwelling of metalimnetic water represented by the 3-D model. These transient dynamics, though a relatively small portion of an annual phosphorus budget, may supply nutrients to epilimnetic phytoplankton during periods of nutrient limitation. There is a need for further research that combines 3-D hydrodynamic modeling with field collection of biological and chemical data.},

Ice duration has shortened and the ice-off date has become earlier for Lake Mendota from 1905 to 2000 as air temperatures have warmed and snowfall has increased. In addition, the ice record has cyclic components at inter-annual and inter-decadal scales. We examined the frequency domain relations between ice, local climate and the teleconnections, Southern Ocean Oscillation (SOI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Northern Pacific Index (NP), through a three-tiered analysis of coherence. The coherence results provide evidence of linear relations between the three levels at inter-annual and inter-decadal frequencies. Of the three local climate variables analyzed, namely temperature, snowfall and snow depth, temperature is the variable that most significantly affects ice duration and ice-off date, at both inter-annual and inter-decadal frequencies. The most significant effect of teleconnections on local climate are the effects of PDO on snowfall and snow depth, and SOI on temperature, at inter-annual frequencies, and the effect of NAO on snowfall at inter-decadal frequencies. The teleconnections that most significantly affect ice-cover duration and ice-off date, particularly at inter-decadal frequencies, are the PDO and the NAO. The influence of PDO on ice-cover appears to be transmitted through temperature, while the influence of the NAO appears to be transmitted through temperature and snowfall. A cascading set of links between teleconnections, local climate, and lake ice explain some, but not all, of the dynamics in these time series.},

High-frequency in situ automated sensor data and long-term manual observational data from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, were used to parameterize, calibrate, and evaluate model predictions. We focused specifically on short-term predictions of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and phytoplankton biomass over one season. Traditional goodness-of-fit metrics indicated more accurate prediction of physics than chemical or biological variables in the time domain. This was confirmed by wavelet analysis in both the time and frequency domains. For temperature, predicted and observed global wavelet spectra were closely related, while observed dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence spectral characteristics were not reproduced by the model for key time scales, indicating that processes not modeled may be important drivers of the observed signal. Although the magnitude and timing of physical and biological changes were simulated adequately at the seasonal time scale through calibration, time scale-specific dynamics, for example short-term cycles, were difficult to reproduce, and were relatively insensitive to the effects of varying parameters. The use of wavelet analysis is novel to aquatic ecosystem modeling, is complementary to traditional goodness-of-fit metrics, and allows for assessment of variability at specific temporal scales. In this way, the effect of processes operating at distinct temporal scales can be isolated and better understood, both in situ and in silico. Wavelet transforms are particularly well suited for assessment of temporal and spatial heterogeneity when coupled to high-frequency data from automated in situ or remote sensing platforms.},

Water quality management continues to focus on aggregated metrics, such as chlorophyll and total nutrients, which may not be sufficient to explain complex community changes and functions such as toxin production. For example, nitrogen (N) speciation and cycling play an important role, on daily time scales, in shaping cyanobacterial communities because declining N has been shown to select for N fixers. In addition, subsequent N pulses from N2 fixation may stimulate and sustain toxic cyanobacterial growth. Herein, we describe how rapid early summer declines in N followed by bursts of N fixation have shaped cyanobacterial communities in a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA), possibly driving toxic Microcystis blooms throughout the growing season. On weekly time scales in 2010 and 2011, we monitored the cyanobacterial community in a eutrophic lake using the phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) region to determine population dynamics. In parallel, we measured microcystin concentrations, N2 fixation rates, and potential environmental drivers that contribute to structuring the community. In both years, cyanobacterial community change was strongly correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations, and Aphanizomenon and Microcystis alternated dominance throughout the pre-toxic, toxic, and posttoxic phases of the lake. Microcystin concentrations increased a few days after the first significant N2 fixation rates were observed. Then, following large early summer N2 fixation events, Microcystis increased and became most abundant. Maximum microcystin concentrations coincided with Microcystis dominance. In both years, DIN concentrations dropped again in late summer, and N2 fixation rates and Aphanizomenon abundance increased before the lake mixed in the fall. Estimated N inputs from N2 fixation were large enough to supplement, or even support, the toxic Microcystis blooms.},

Observations show that Lake Mendota has experienced significant changes in ice cover: later ice-on date(9.0 days later per century), earlier ice-off date (12.3 days per century), decreasing ice cover duration (21.3 days per century), while model simulations indicate a change in maximum ice thickness (12.7{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}cm decrease per century). Model simulations also show changes in the lake thermal regime of earlier stratification onset (12.3 days per century), later fall turnover (14.6 days per century), longer stratification duration (26.8 days per century), and decreasing summer hypolimnetic temperatures (−1.4{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}°C per century). Correlation analysis of lake variables and driving variables revealed ice cover variables, stratification onset, epilimnetic temperature, and hypolimnetic temperature were most closely correlated with air temperature, whereas freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic heating, and fall turnover date were more closely correlated with wind speed. Each lake variable (i.e., ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, maximum ice thickness, freeze-over water temperature, stratification onset, fall turnover date, stratification duration, epilimnion temperature, hypolimnion temperature, and hypolimnetic heating) was averaged for the three periods (1911–1980, 1981–1993, and 1994–2014) delineated by abrupt changes in air temperature and wind speed. Average summer hypolimnetic temperature and fall turnover date exhibit significant differences between the third period and the first two periods. Changes in ice cover (ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover duration, and maximum ice thickness) exhibit an abrupt change after 1994, which was related in part to the warm El Niño winter of 1997–1998. Under-ice water temperature, freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic temperature, fall turnover date, and stratification duration demonstrate a significant difference in the third period (1994–2014), when air temperature was warmest and wind speeds decreased rather abruptly. The trends in ice cover and water temperature demonstrate responses to both long-term and abrupt changes in meteorological conditions that can be complemented with numerical modeling to better understand how these variables will respond in a future climate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cultural eutrophication of lakes due to excess loading of nutrients is a global problem affecting the provisioning of freshwater ecosystem services. Lake water quality is often described by trophic state indicators such as water clarity or concentrations of nutrients, chlorophyll, and cyanobacteria toxins. While these indicators are widely assumed to covary, capturing the same basic aspects of water quality, they can be uncoupled by changes in lake food webs. Outbreak of the invasive predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes longimanus, in Lakes Mendota and Monona, Wisconsin (U.S.A.) in 2009 led to a decline in the herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, and in turn, water clarity. We use 20-yr datasets for Lakes Mendota and Monona to evaluate interactions among nutrients, zooplankton, and phytoplankton that resulted in this trophic cascade. After invasion, diatoms increased in both lakes resulting in reduced water clarity, whereas cyanobacteria did not change in either lake. Multivariate time series analysis revealed that D. pulicaria grazing controlled edible diatoms in both lakes. Cyanobacteria biomass was positively associated with both D. pulicaria and summer nutrient concentrations. These results further clarify the limitations of top-down control in eutrophic lakes: grazing by zooplankton can control edible phytoplankton taxa, but largely inedible cyanobacteria may be more limited by nutrient concentrations. Accordingly, despite declining clarity in Lake Mendota, the number of beach closures due to cyanobacteria blooms declined following Bythotrephes invasion. Our study reveals how these two indicators of water quality—water clarity and cyanobacteria blooms—can become uncoupled during a food web shift.},

We hypothesized that differences in thermal structure, nutrients, and meteorology drive interannual variability in CCC and abundance. Cluster analysis differentiated dominant cyanobacteria into rare, low abundance, or sporadically occurring taxa. The bloom-forming genera were Microcystis and Aphanizomenon, accounting for {\textasciitilde} 70\% of total cyanobacterial biovolume (BV) on average, whereas unusually high abundance of Planktothrix, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria were clear outliers in three of the years. Variability in CCC was significantly correlated (P {\textless} 0.05, R {\textgreater} 0.3) with ice duration, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and spring nitrite + nitrate (NO2+3); ice duration and TKN were associated with the occurrence of primarily non-bloom-forming genera. Pairwise correlations tested linear, exponential, and polynomial correlates of absolute and relative total Cyanophyta, Microcystis, or Aphanizomenon BV. TKN, total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP), TN:TP ratio, Schmidt stability, and rainfall correlated with total Cyanophyta, Microcystis, and Aphanizomenon BV, whereas ice cover, NO2+3, and TKN correlated with relative Microcystis and Aphanizomenon BV. Despite increasing TN:TP ratio over two decades, cyanobacterial abundance had not changed significantly. These data suggest differing responses of cyanobacterial genera to important environmental factors over two decades.},

	abstract = {Human impacts on freshwater ecosystems are pervasive, but the short and discontinuous nature of most datasets limits our ability to understand the controls on water quality and effectively manage freshwater resources. We examine change in Lake Mendota (Madison, Wisconsin) over the last two centuries by pairing analyses of a sedimentary archive with the site’s {\textgreater} 100 yr limnological record. We show that eutrophication of the lake, evident as an abrupt shift in sediment composition, began in the late 19th century following the intensiﬁcation of urban and agricultural land use in the watershed. Efforts to address deterioration of lake water quality, including the removal of point-source pollutants and biomanipulation, have had a measurable inﬂuence on sediment composition and water clarity. Since the early 1980s, quasi-seasonal cycles of phytoplankton blooms have induced calcite precipitation, leaving distinct laminations in the sedimentary record. These “whiting events” evidently did not accumulate in lake sediments until the late 20th century, indicating that efforts to remediate water quality have shifted the lake to a new ecosystem state. Calcite whitings can improve water quality in eutrophic lakes by coprecipitation with phosphate, increasing phosphorus (P) burial in lake sediments. Using long-term limnological records, we report negative correlations between calcite saturation indices and P in lake surface waters and show that calcite whitings could partially explain recent P decline in Lake Mendota surface waters. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized potential control on water quality in this eutrophic lake and demonstrates the beneﬁt of coupling long-term limnological data with sedimentary records.},

	abstract = {Cisco (Coregonus artedi) are an important indicator species for cold-water lake habitats in the Great Lakes region, and many populations have been extirpated at their southern range limit over the last century. Understanding the roles of climate and water quality in these extirpations should inform protection of cold-water fishes. Using the water temperature at the depth where dissolved oxygen falls to 3 mg L−1 (TDO3) as a metric, we investigated the roles of climate and water quality as drivers of habitat availability for cisco in Lake Mendota, WI, USA from 1976 to 2013. We find that summer (Jun−Aug) air temperatures, spring (Mar−May) phosphorus load, and spring inflow influence summer TDO3. Warm air temperatures lead to the greatest increases in TDO3, whereas reduced phosphorus loads can reduce TDO3, thus alleviating oxythermal stress. Under air temperatures expected under the A1B climate change scenario, a 25\% reduction in phosphorus load would stabilize TDO3 at current levels, while a 75\% reduction in phosphorus loading would be required to expand oxythermal habitat. Costs of these reductions are estimated to range from US\$16.9 million (−25\%) to US\$155–167 million (−75\%) over a 20-year period but may be feasible by expanding upon current watershed phosphorus reduction initiatives if sustained funding were available. Identifying targeted reductions will become increasingly important throughout the region as warmer temperatures and longer stratification reduces cool- and cold-water fish habitat in many Midwestern lakes under the expected future climate.},

	abstract = {Elucidating patterns and mechanisms that shape phytoplankton assemblages is a popular area of research for empirical and theoretical ecologists. Despite the daunting complexity of phytoplankton dynamics, much of our current understanding has been based on simple models describing food-web interactions with few differential equations. Skeptical views in the literature raise concerns about the increasing model complexity and advice to seek parsimony rather than simplicity. To address this controversy (simple versus complex models), we propose the introduction of an extra layer of causality into plankton models by connecting algal processes (maximum growth rates, nutrient kinetics, settling velocities, metabolic rates) with species-specific morphological features (cell volume, surface-to-volume ratio, shape). In this study, we demonstrate the capacity of a size-based plankton model to reproduce observed water quality patterns (phosphate, total phosphorus, nitrate, total ammonia, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and total zooplankton biomass) in the Hamilton Harbour, Ontario. Consistent with empirical evidence, our modeling analysis showed that small algal species have a distinct competitive advantage in summer epilimnetic environments across the range of cell volume and nutrient loading conditions examined; especially, when they are characterized by higher optimal temperature for growth. Strong top-down pressure mediated by high zooplankton abundance effectively controls the standing biomass of phytoplankton species that can otherwise realize high growth rates under the conditions typically prevailing in the end-of-summer epilimnetic environments (e.g., higher temperature optima, higher tolerance in low water clarity). Under high zooplankton control, the secondary variations of phytoplankton are modulated by the ambient phosphorus levels and the size-based strategies for resources procurement, such as the regulation of nutrient transport kinetics. By contrast, when the summer algal assemblage is released by the zooplankton grazing, the exceedance of critical phytoplankton biomass levels and the likelihood of harmful algal blooms are determined by the multitude of factors that shape inter-specific competition patterns (e.g., relative abundance of competing species, nutrient uptake kinetics). Our study evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and identifies future directions that would provide operational models founded upon concepts of allometry.},

	abstract = {One of the founding principles of modern aquatic ecology is that human-induced perturbations in the autotroph-herbivore interface have the potential to affect ecological processes at higher trophic levels. Thus, zooplankton’s physiological state can be an early warning sign of broader impairments of aquatic ecosystems. Based on this reasoning, the micro-crustacean Daphnia is often identified as a keystone freshwater species, but its bioenergetic motivations and physiological priorities remain only partially understood. Using a bioenergetically explicit ecophysiological approach, we model how trade-offs in resource allocation can shape a daphnid's growth. Our multi-faceted hierarchical approach to metabolite utilization challenges the popular paradigm of elemental stoichiometry being the primary regulatory factor of algal food quality. We examine the post-gut bioenergetic ramifications of an unbalanced diet, showing that animal growth can be significantly compromised by the elevated energetic requirements of homeostasis. Our modeling framework offers an excellent stepping-stone to connect zooplankton physiological processes with the signals of external stressors, and subsequently evaluate the patterns of mass and energy flow at an ecosystem scale. The proposed microscopic-to-macroscopic strategy will likely offer a new prospect towards the development of early warning systems for the management of freshwater resources.},

The water quality component consists of 13 state variables which may include up to three algal groups, BOD, dissolved oxygen and four components of the dissolved oxygen budget (inflows, biochemical processes, surface aeration and oxygen present in the reservoir at the start of a simulation), nutrients (PO4P, NO3N, NH4N, TP and TN) and inorganic particles. The particle model simulates settling and flocculation/deflocculation of up to seven different size classes of particles. The hydrodynamic, water quality and particle models interact on a sub-daily time step. Forcing data for the model are entered as daily-averaged values. The ecological component requires calibration for each new application through adjustment of several different biological and chemical parameters. Literature ranges for these parameters are wide, but provided the process description is correct, many of the parameters can be validated with measured data.},

This pore water, which was assumed to represent seepage inflow, was considerably lower in nitrogen and phosphorus than surface inflow but was higher in phosphorus and lower in nitrogen than well water, indicating that well chemistry does not provide a good indication of the composition of groundwater entering lakes. Calculations indicated that seepage accounted for 12\% of the total phosphorus loading to Lake Mendota and 2\% of the total nitrogen budget.

High-frequency in situ automated sensor data and long-term manual observational data from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, were used to parameterize, calibrate, and evaluate model predictions. We focused specifically on short-term predictions of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and phytoplankton biomass over one season. Traditional goodness-of-fit metrics indicated more accurate prediction of physics than chemical or biological variables in the time domain. This was confirmed by wavelet analysis in both the time and frequency domains. For temperature, predicted and observed global wavelet spectra were closely related, while observed dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence spectral characteristics were not reproduced by the model for key time scales, indicating that processes not modeled may be important drivers of the observed signal. Although the magnitude and timing of physical and biological changes were simulated adequately at the seasonal time scale through calibration, time scale-specific dynamics, for example short-term cycles, were difficult to reproduce, and were relatively insensitive to the effects of varying parameters. The use of wavelet analysis is novel to aquatic ecosystem modeling, is complementary to traditional goodness-of-fit metrics, and allows for assessment of variability at specific temporal scales. In this way, the effect of processes operating at distinct temporal scales can be isolated and better understood, both in situ and in silico. Wavelet transforms are particularly well suited for assessment of temporal and spatial heterogeneity when coupled to high-frequency data from automated in situ or remote sensing platforms.},

We estimated how nutrient management programs and legislation have affected the budget by comparing the budget for 2007 to a budget calculated for 1995, prior to implementation of the programs. Since 1995, inputs decreased from 1,310,000 to 853,000 kg P/yr (35\% reduction) and accumulation decreased from 575,000 to 279,000 kg P/yr (51\% reduction). Changes in P input and accumulation were attributed primarily to enhanced agricultural nutrient management, reduction in dairy cattle feed supplements and an urban P fertilizer ban. Four scenarios were investigated to determine potential impacts of additional nutrient management tactics on the watershed P budget and P loading to Lake Mendota. Elimination of chemical P fertilizer input has the greatest potential to reduce watershed P accumulation and establishment of riparian buffers has the greatest potential to prevent P loading to Lake Mendota.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the issues related to the use of validation in hydrological model calibration. Traditionally, models are calibrated and then assessed on an independent period (split-sample) to determine their adequacy in simulating streamflow as compared to observations. In this study, two hydrological models and three North American catchments are used to evaluate the effects of using validation to assess the model parameters’ robustness on the model’s actual simulation capabilities and accuracy in simulating streamflow. The length of the calibration period is increased from 1 to 16 years, and for each case a large number of randomly selected combinations of years are used for calibration and for validation using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency metric. The calibrated model is then run on an independent 8-year test-period to assess the model’s actual performance in simulation mode in unknown conditions. The process is bootstrapped 30 times to ensure the robustness of the results. The tests pit the calibration/validation methods on increasing calibration period lengths against a full calibration on the entire available dataset. Results show that the calibration on the full dataset is the optimal strategy as it generates the most robust parameter sets, provides the best model accuracy on an independent testing period and does not require assumption-making on the modeler’s part. The calibrated parameter sets for each test-case were evaluated using the relative bias and correlation metrics, which revealed that the method transfers well to these two other metrics. Results also demonstrate the pitfalls of the commonly used split-sampling strategy, where good parameter sets may be discarded due to model performance discrepancies between calibration and validation periods. The conclusions point to the need to use as many years as possible in the calibration step and to entirely disregard the validation aspect under certain conditions.},

	abstract = {Cisco (Coregonus artedi) are an important indicator species for cold-water lake habitats in the Great Lakes region, and many populations have been extirpated at their southern range limit over the last century. Understanding the roles of climate and water quality in these extirpations should inform protection of cold-water fishes. Using the water temperature at the depth where dissolved oxygen falls to 3 mg L−1 (TDO3) as a metric, we investigated the roles of climate and water quality as drivers of habitat availability for cisco in Lake Mendota, WI, USA from 1976 to 2013. We find that summer (Jun−Aug) air temperatures, spring (Mar−May) phosphorus load, and spring inflow influence summer TDO3. Warm air temperatures lead to the greatest increases in TDO3, whereas reduced phosphorus loads can reduce TDO3, thus alleviating oxythermal stress. Under air temperatures expected under the A1B climate change scenario, a 25\% reduction in phosphorus load would stabilize TDO3 at current levels, while a 75\% reduction in phosphorus loading would be required to expand oxythermal habitat. Costs of these reductions are estimated to range from US\$16.9 million (−25\%) to US\$155–167 million (−75\%) over a 20-year period but may be feasible by expanding upon current watershed phosphorus reduction initiatives if sustained funding were available. Identifying targeted reductions will become increasingly important throughout the region as warmer temperatures and longer stratification reduces cool- and cold-water fish habitat in many Midwestern lakes under the expected future climate.},

We present a model to calculate the epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature of inland water bodies based on air temperature and on their geographical and morphological characteristics. The seven model parameters were parameterized by using official monitoring data and the satellite temperature data of the data set LakeSST for French water bodies. The performance of the parameterised model was compared to that of two widely used models (FLake and air2water with four parameters). The model showed a good performance in the simulation of epilimnion temperatures, especially in the summer. For hypolimnion temperatures the performance was worse, but still comparable to that of other models. Because of its good performance and the few data needed to run the model, it is a good choice for managers interested in the thermal behaviour of inland water bodies.},

The strength of stratification substantially influences the transport of water parcels from the surface to the bottom of a lake. In recent years, the stratification in Lake Biwa—the largest freshwater lake in Japan—has been stronger. However, it is difficult to reproduce the stratification well in the simulations. In the present study, we built a hydrodynamic model for the purpose of analyzing the structure of the stratification in detail. Using the model, we evaluated the reproducibility of the seasonal and annual changes of vertical water distribution and flow field in Lake Biwa from 2007 to 2011. The hydrodynamic model results show that the vertical water distribution approximately agrees with the field observations based on the statistical analysis. The seasonal change of thermal stratification is reasonably reproduced by the hydrodynamic model simulations. In the simulation, there are mainly two circulation flows at the surface layer of the lake. The first flows anticlockwise and the second flows clockwise in the northern part of Lake Biwa. In order to compensate for the surface water flow, the water under the thermocline sometimes flows in the opposite direction under each circulation flow.},

Several episodes of density current intrusions are documented. Water temperatures and salinities measured near the bottom of a 10 m deep Minneapolis lake during the late winter warming periods in 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1995 show significant rapid changes which are correlated with observed higher air temperatures and snowmelt runoff. The snowmelt runoff entering this particular lake (Ryan Lake) has increased electrical conductivity, salinity, and density. The source of the salinity is the salt spread on urban streets in the winter. Heating of littoral waters in spring may also contribute to the occurrence of the sinking flows, but is clearly not the only cause.},

The main result is that Z ∼ E−1/3B1/3/N. It is shown that the depth of the intrusion scales as Z ∼ (3 ± 1)B1/3/N for laboratory experiments, and as  for oceanic density currents. The velocity of a large-scale density current is controlled by a geostrophic balance defined as Ugeo = 0.25g′s/f, where s is the slope and f is the Coriolis parameter. The geostrophic buoyancy flux is then defined by Bgeo = g′Ugeoh, with g′ the reduced gravity and h the thickness of the current. The scaling  herein implies that the depth of an oceanic intrusion is relatively insensitive to changes in source water properties but is very sensitive to changes in the stratification of the water column, consistent with the previous scaling of Price and Baringer. For example, if the buoyancy flux of a dense current were to double while the stratification remained constant, then there would only be a 25\% increase in the intrusion depth, whereas doubling the stratification would result in a 50\% decrease of the intrusion depth.},

High-resolution temperature proﬁles were taken within the upper sediment, accompanied by temperature and oxygen measurements within the overlying water. Heat transport in the upper sediment alternated between diffusion and convection at the periodicity of the internal seiches, with the strongest oscillations at a period of 2.4 h. During long-duration events (O30 min) of seiche-driven cooling of the sediment surface, the thermal instability extended as much as 9 cm down into the sediment, followed by free convective transport in the upper sediment. The vertical convective heat ﬂuxes were close to those of Rayleigh–Be´nard convection for pure ﬂuid ﬂow. The convective heat ﬂuxes were, on average, three times higher than the diffusive heat ﬂuxes, and the maximum convective heat ﬂuxes of 50–100 W m–2 were 10–20 times higher than the maximum diffusive heat ﬂuxes. Internal seiches caused advective oxygen ﬂuctuations above the sediment that can potentially reinforce the effect of convection on biochemical processes within the lake sediments. Periodic temperature and oxygen variations due to internal seiching can cover w10\% of the sediment area, depending on seasonal stratiﬁcation and lake morphometry. In these areas, convection intensiﬁes the transport of heat, nutrients, and oxygen through the sediment surface and represents an important feature of the ecology of lakes.},

	abstract = {Despite providing water-related services as the primary purpose of urban water system (UWS), all relevant activities require capital investments and operational expenditures, consume resources (e.g. materials and chemicals), and may increase negative environmental impacts (e.g. contaminant discharge, emissions to water and air). Performance assessment of such a metabolic system may require developing a holistic approach which encompasses various system elements and criteria. This paper analyses the impact of integration of UWS components on the metabolism based performance assessment for future planning using a number of intervention strategies. It also explores the importance of sustainability based criteria in the assessment of long-term planning. Two assessment approaches analysed here are: (1) planning for only water supply system (WSS) as a part of the UWS and (2) planning for an integrated UWS including potable water, stormwater, wastewater and water recycling. WaterMet2 model is used to simulate metabolic type processes in the UWS and calculate quantitative performance indicators. The analysis is demonstrated on the problem of strategic level planning of a real-world UWS to where optional intervention strategies are applied. The resulting performance is assessed using the multiple criteria of both conventional and sustainability type; and optional intervention strategies are then ranked using the Compromise Programming method. The results obtained show that the high ranked intervention strategies in the integrated UWS are those supporting both water supply and stormwater/wastewater subsystems (e.g. rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling schemes) whilst these strategies are ranked low in the WSS and those targeting improvement of water supply components only (e.g. rehabilitation of clean water pipes and addition of new water resources) are preferred instead. Results also demonstrate that both conventional and sustainability type performance indicators are necessary for strategic planning in the UWS.},

	abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is increasingly used to study a wide variety of complex Environmental Fluid Mechanics (EFM) processes, such as water ﬂow and turbulent mixing of contaminants in rivers and estuaries and wind ﬂow and air pollution dispersion in urban areas. However, the accuracy and reliability of CFD modeling and the correct use of CFD results can easily be compromised. In 2006, Jakeman et al. set out ten iterative steps of good disciplined model practice to develop purposeful, credible models from data and a priori knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision (Jakeman et al., 2006). This paper discusses the application of the ten-steps approach to CFD for EFM in three parts. In the ﬁrst part, the existing best practice guidelines for CFD applications in this area are reviewed and positioned in the ten-steps framework. The second and third part present a retrospective analysis of two case studies in the light of the ten-steps approach: (1) contaminant dispersion due to transverse turbulent mixing in a shallow water ﬂow and (2) coupled urban wind ﬂow and indoor natural ventilation of the Amsterdam ArenA football stadium. It is shown that the existing best practice guidelines for CFD mainly focus on the last steps in the ten-steps framework. The reasons for this focus are outlined and the value of the additional e preceding e steps is discussed. The retrospective analysis of the case studies indicates that the ten-steps approach is very well applicable to CFD for EFM and that it provides a comprehensive framework that encompasses and extends the existing best practice guidelines.},

	abstract = {The aim was to disclose the seasonality in the internal seiches during summer stratification in 2010 within the small, 3 km long, ellipse-shaped, temperate Lake Arendsee (Germany) with simple morphometry. We used observations of temperatures from two thermistor chains (09 April to 24 September), conductivity and temperature profiles, and wind speeds and directions (January to December). To analyze the seasonality in the periods, appearance and modal structure of the seiches, and the wind forcing, we applied spectral analysis on monthly time series of isotherms and wind speeds, and wavelet analysis on 6 month long time series of integrated potential energy and wind speeds. To determine the effect of earth’s rotation on seiches, we applied two analytical models based on three-layer density stratification. Earth’s rotation affected internal seiches significantly even in a small lake. That was shown by the models and the Burger number being , 1 during stratification. Vertical mode 1 Kelvin-type seiches dominated the internal seiche weather in Lake Arendsee, with their periods changing because of seasonal variations in stratification. Weak, free seiches of vertical mode 2 were amplified during three episodes: (1) in midsummer, when their periods coincided with the inertial period at the lake’s latitude, (2) in late spring, and (3) in autumn, both when their periods approached 24 h. The amplifications were caused by resonance between free seiches and wind-forced oscillations at diurnal and inertial periods. Such short-term resonance events, associated with enhanced mixing, are inherent for the seasonal stratification cycle in the most temperate lakes.},

	abstract = {The aim was to disclose the seasonality in the internal seiches during summer stratification in 2010 within the small, 3 km long, ellipse-shaped, temperate Lake Arendsee (Germany) with simple morphometry. We used observations of temperatures from two thermistor chains (09 April to 24 September), conductivity and temperature profiles, and wind speeds and directions (January to December). To analyze the seasonality in the periods, appearance and modal structure of the seiches, and the wind forcing, we applied spectral analysis on monthly time series of isotherms and wind speeds, and wavelet analysis on 6 month long time series of integrated potential energy and wind speeds. To determine the effect of earth’s rotation on seiches, we applied two analytical models based on three-layer density stratification. Earth’s rotation affected internal seiches significantly even in a small lake. That was shown by the models and the Burger number being , 1 during stratification. Vertical mode 1 Kelvin-type seiches dominated the internal seiche weather in Lake Arendsee, with their periods changing because of seasonal variations in stratification. Weak, free seiches of vertical mode 2 were amplified during three episodes: (1) in midsummer, when their periods coincided with the inertial period at the lake’s latitude, (2) in late spring, and (3) in autumn, both when their periods approached 24 h. The amplifications were caused by resonance between free seiches and wind-forced oscillations at diurnal and inertial periods. Such short-term resonance events, associated with enhanced mixing, are inherent for the seasonal stratification cycle in the most temperate lakes.},

	abstract = {Despite providing water-related services as the primary purpose of urban water system (UWS), all relevant activities require capital investments and operational expenditures, consume resources (e.g. materials and chemicals), and may increase negative environmental impacts (e.g. contaminant discharge, emissions to water and air). Performance assessment of such a metabolic system may require developing a holistic approach which encompasses various system elements and criteria. This paper analyses the impact of integration of UWS components on the metabolism based performance assessment for future planning using a number of intervention strategies. It also explores the importance of sustainability based criteria in the assessment of long-term planning. Two assessment approaches analysed here are: (1) planning for only water supply system (WSS) as a part of the UWS and (2) planning for an integrated UWS including potable water, stormwater, wastewater and water recycling. WaterMet2 model is used to simulate metabolic type processes in the UWS and calculate quantitative performance indicators. The analysis is demonstrated on the problem of strategic level planning of a real-world UWS to where optional intervention strategies are applied. The resulting performance is assessed using the multiple criteria of both conventional and sustainability type; and optional intervention strategies are then ranked using the Compromise Programming method. The results obtained show that the high ranked intervention strategies in the integrated UWS are those supporting both water supply and stormwater/wastewater subsystems (e.g. rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling schemes) whilst these strategies are ranked low in the WSS and those targeting improvement of water supply components only (e.g. rehabilitation of clean water pipes and addition of new water resources) are preferred instead. Results also demonstrate that both conventional and sustainability type performance indicators are necessary for strategic planning in the UWS.},

It is also desirable, in order to simplify theoretical analysis, that the parameters in production equations be chosen so as to minimize the range of values needed to describe the variation of photosynthesis in nature. This can be achieved by choosing the quantum yield of photosynthesis in weak light as parameter instead of the maximum rate in saturating light. In lakes, the value of the quantum yield in weak light is likely to be about 0.06 moles carbon per einstein absorbed. An additional advantage of the transformed equations is to make evident a simple relation between actual daily production and the upper limit to production.},

	abstract = {The impact of sulfate pollution is increasingly being seen as an issue in the management of inland aquatic ecosystems. In this study we use sediment slurry experiments to explore the addition of sulfate, with or without added carbon, on the anaerobic biogeochemical cycles in a wetland sediment that previously had not been exposed to high levels of sulfate. Speciﬁcally we looked at the cycling of S (sulfate, dissolved and particulate sulﬁde e the latter measured as acid volatile sulﬁde; AVS), C (carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, methane and the short chain volatile fatty acids formate, acetate, butyrate and propionate), N (dinitrogen, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite) and redox active metals (Fe(II) and Mn(II)). Sulfate had the largest effects on the cycling of S and C. All the added S at lower loadings were converted to AVS over the course of the experiment (30 days). At the highest loading (8 mmol) less than 50\% of consumed S was converted to AVS, however this is believed to be a kinetic effect. Although sulfate reduction was occurring in sediments with added sulfate, dissolved sulﬁde concentrations remained low throughout the study. Sulfate addition affected methanogenesis. In the absence of added carbon, addition of sulfate, even at a loading of 1 mmol, resulted in a halving of methane formation. The initial rate of formation of methane was not affected by sulfate if additional carbon was added to the sediment. However, there was evidence for anaerobic methane oxidation in those sediments with added sulfate and carbon, but not in those sediments treated only with carbon. Surprisingly, sulfate addition had little apparent impact on N dynamics; previous studies have shown that sulﬁde can inhibit denitriﬁcation and stimulate dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia. We propose that because most of the reduced sulfur was in particulate form, levels of dissolved sulﬁde were too low to interfere with the N cycle.},

	abstract = {Realistic modelling of marine ecosystems is necessary for improving our understanding of the ocean’s biogeochemical state and for predicting their response to anthropic perturbations. An essential step in achieving this task is the use of mechanistic formulations to describe the biogeochemical processes involved in the dynamics of marine pelagic ecosystems. This study provides a review on some modelling strategies for some of the key processes involved in the dynamics of phytoplankton. It encompasses the most advanced work in terms of mechanistic understanding and, therefore, mainly deals with photosynthesis (including photoacclimation and photoinhibition), respiration, and nutrient uptake (including multilimitation of algal growth by nutrients). We highlight, that in many ecosystem models, phytoplankton processes are still described more or less empirically, mainly due to a lack of biochemical knowledge, or if a mechanistic formulation exists, the parameters are often diﬃcult to assess experimentally. As a result of this investigation, a preliminary structure for a generic phytoplankton model is delivered in the last section of this paper. This model includes a mechanistic representation of photosynthesis/photoinhibition based on photosystem II status, as well as new formulations for photoacclimation and dissolved organic matter exudation processes. The model sensitivity analysis with regard to its parameters and a comparison with chemostat experimental data are presented in a companion paper [Baklouti, M., Faure, V., Pawlowski, L., Sciandra, A., 2006. Investigation and sensitivity analysis of a mechanistic phytoplankton model implemented in a new modular numerical tool (Eco3M) dedicated to biogeochemical modelling. Progress in Oceanography]. Finally, this new class of multi-element, multi-species phytoplankton models will provide the basis for future studies on ecosystem modelling.},

It is the default class of models implemented in our new numerical tool Eco3M, which is dedicated to Ecological, Mechanistic and Modular Modelling. A brief overview of its main features is given in Section 2 of the present paper. In the next sections, a particular phytoplankton model among the aforementioned class has been tested with special emphasis on the mechanistic photosynthesis component relating the photosynthetic rate to the proportion of open photosystems II. The present study encompasses several essential steps that are inherent to any modelling, including model reduction, model sensitivity analysis and comparison of model outputs with experiments. The global sensitivity analysis of the plankton model for one-at-a-time parameter perturbations revealed a restricted set of parameters having major inﬂuence on the model outputs. Sensitivity tests involving simultaneous parameter perturbations within the range actually encountered in the literature provided a conﬁdence interval for the outputs. Chemostat experiments performed on nitrate-limited diatoms grown under low (LL) and high-light (HL) conditions have been used for comparison with model outputs. The good ﬁt between measured data and model outputs using the same parameter values in both the LL and HL cases demonstrates the ability of our model to represent the main features of phytoplankton dynamics including photoacclimation. Finally, Eco3M is ultimately intended to include explicit bacterial and zooplankton compartments, as well as to be coupled with ocean circulation models, but the intrinsic behavior of the phytoplankton model has been investigated ﬁrst, independently of physical forcing.},

	abstract = {Microplastics represent an increasing source of anthropogenic contamination in aquatic environments, where they may also act as scavengers and transporters of persistent organic pollutants. As estuaries are amongst the most productive aquatic systems, it is important to understand sorption behaviour and transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by microplastics along estuarine gradients. The effects of salinity sorption equilibrium kinetics on the distribution coefﬁcients (Kd) of phenanthrene (Phe) and 4,40-DDT, onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and onto polyethylene (PE) were therefore investigated. A salinity gradient representing freshwater, estuarine and marine conditions, with salinities corresponding to 0 (MilliQ water, 690 mS/cm), 8.8, 17.5, 26.3 and 35 was used. Salinity had no signiﬁcant effect on the time required to reach equilibrium onto PVC or PE and neither did it affect desorption rates of contaminants from plastics. Although salinity had no effect on sorption capacity of Phe onto plastics, a slight decrease in sorption capacity was observed for DDT with salinity. Salinity had little effect on sorption behaviour and POP/plastic combination was shown to be a more important factor. Transport of Phe and DDT from riverine to brackish and marine waters by plastic is therefore likely to be much more dependent on the aqueous POP concentration than on salinity. The physical characteristics of the polymer and local environmental conditions (e.g. plastic density, particle residence time in estuaries) will affect the physical transport of contaminated plastics. A transport model of POPs by microplastics under estuarine conditions is proposed. Transport of Phe and DDT by PVC and PE from fresh and brackish water toward fully marine conditions was the most likely net direction for contaminant transport and followed the order: Phe-PE {\textgreater}{\textgreater} DDT-PVC ¼ DDT-PE {\textgreater}{\textgreater} Phe-PVC.},

We investigated the potential for polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) to sorb and desorb 14C-DDT, 14C-phenanthrene (Phe), 14Cperﬂuorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and 14C-di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Desorption rates of POPs were quantiﬁed in seawater and under simulated gut conditions. Inﬂuence of pH and temperature was examined in order to represent cold and warm blooded organisms. Desorption rates were faster with gut surfactant, with a further substantial increase under conditions simulating warm blooded organisms. Desorption under gut conditions could be up to 30 times greater than in seawater alone. Of the POP/ plastic combinations examined Phe with PE gave the highest potential for transport to organisms.},

	abstract = {The fate of iron (Fe) may aﬀect that of phosphorus (P) and arsenic (As) in natural waters. This study addresses the removal of Fe, P, and As from streams in lowland catchments fed by reduced, Ferich groundwater (average: 20 mg Fe L−1). The concentrations of dissolved Fe ({\textless}0.45 μm) in streams gradually decrease with increasing hydraulic residence time (travel time) of the water in the catchment. The removal of Fe from streamwater is governed by chemical reactions and hydrological processes: the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and the subsequent formation of particulate Fe oxyhydroxides proceeds as the water ﬂows through the catchment into increasingly larger streams. The Fe removal exhibits ﬁrst-order kinetics with a mean half-life of 12 h, a value in line with predictions by a kinetic model for Fe(II) oxidation. The Fe concentrations in streams vary seasonally: they are higher in winter than in summer, due to shorter hydraulic residence time and lower temperature in winter. The removal of P and As is much faster than that of Fe. The average concentrations of P and As in streams (42 μg P L−1 and 1.4 μg As L−1) are 1 order of magnitude below those in groundwater (393 μg P L−1 and 17 μg As L−1). This removal is attributed to fast sequestration by oxidizing Fe when the water enters oxic environments, possibly by adsorption on Fe oxyhydroxides or by formation of ferric phosphates. The average P and As concentrations in groundwater largely exceed local environmental limits for freshwater (140 μg P L−1 and 3 μg As L−1), but in streams, they are below these limits. Naturally occurring Fe in groundwater may alleviate the environmental risk associated with P and As in the receiving streams.},

	abstract = {The promulgation of numeric nutrient criteria for evaluating impairment of waterbodies in Florida is underway. Adherence to the water quality standards needed to meet these criteria will potentially require substantial allocations of public and private resources in order to better control nutrient (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) releases from contributing sources. Major sources of nutrients include atmospheric deposition (195e380 mg-N/m2/yr, 6 to 16 mg-P/m2/yr), reclaimed water irrigation (0.13e29 mg-N/L, 0.02 to 6 mg-P/L), septic systems (3.3 Â 103e6.68 Â 103 g-N/person/yr, 0.49 Â 103e0.85 Â 103 g-P/person/yr) and fertilizer applications (8 Â 106e24 Â 106 mg-N/m2/yr). Estimated nitrogen loadings to the Florida environment, as calculated from the above rates are as follows: 5.9 Â 109e9.4 Â 109 g-N/yr from atmospheric deposition, 1.2 Â 108e2.6 Â 1010 g-N/yr from reclaimed water, 2.4 Â 1010e4.9 Â 1010 g-N/year from septic systems, and 1.4 Â 1011 g-N/yr from fertilizer application. Similarly, source speciﬁc phosphorus loading calculations are also presented in this paper. A fraction of those nutrient inputs may reach receiving waterbodies depending upon site speciﬁc regulation on nutrient control, nutrient management practices, and environmental attenuation. In Florida, the interconnectivity of hydrologic pathways due to the karst landscape and high volumes of rainfall add to the complexity of tracking nutrient loads back to their sources. In addition to source speciﬁc nutrient loadings, this review discusses the merits of source speciﬁc markers such as elemental isotopes (boron, nitrogen, oxygen, strontium, uranium and carbon) and trace organic compounds (sucralose, gadolinium anomaly, carbamazepine, and galaxolide) in relating nutrient loads back to sources of origin. Although this review is focused in Florida, the development of source speciﬁc markers as a tool for tracing nutrient loadings back to sources of origin is applicable and of value to all other geographical locations.},

Then, the analytes, trapped on Oasis-HLB sorbent, are eluted with ethyl acetate, silylated and determined by GC–MS. The proposed method provides a linear response over the concentration range 2.5–20000 ng/kg with correlation coefﬁcients higher than 0.994 in all cases. Also, it features low limits of detection (0.8–5.1 ng/kg), good precision (within- and between-day relative standard deviation less than 7\%) and recoveries ranging from 91 to 101\%.

	abstract = {A dynamic model for eutrophication incorporating phytoplankton and nutrients in the overlying water, submerged macrophytes Potamogeton pectinatus L., and nutrient dynamics in sediments was developed as a functional tool to understand the effects of macrophytes on algal blooming in shallow lakes. The submodule for the overlying water treats three types of phytoplankton (diatoms, green and blue green algae), the macro-nutrients, as well as dissolved oxygen in the water, while the macrophyte submodule consists of equations for the time-dependence of the macrophyte components: shoots, secondary shoots, roots, tubers, and new tubers. The sediment submodule describes the concentrations of detritus, nitrates, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, and phosphates. These modules are processed simultaneously. The model was applied to the Lake Veluwe (Netherlands) experiment, successfully reproducing the seasonal changes in the lake, such as the transition of the dominant species of phytoplankton from diatoms during spring, green algae in summer, to blue green algae in late autumn depending on the nutrient and light condition, nutrient concentration in the water, and the yearly life-cycle of macrophytes. The model also describes the long term transition in the lake: after artiﬁcial ﬂushing with water rich in nitrates and calcium, the return ﬂux from the sediment decreased, and together with the reduction in the external load, the phosphate concentration in the overlying water decreased. This lessened the phytoplankton biomass in the water, which resulted in the remarkable development of macrophytes under the improved light condition. Sensitivity analyses of important coefﬁcients indicated that the maximum photosynthesis and respiration rate are the most sensitive parameters for macrophyte and algal development. The parameters have sufﬁcient accuracy to be successfully applied to other experiments. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The predictions of the model for biomass of each fraction, standing stock of phosphorus and phosphorus content in shoots, secondary shoots and roots well agree with the observed values. The model successfully simulated the decomposition process, the remaining dry mass, and the phosphorus and nitrogen content of the remaining biomass. A series of numerical experiments were subsequently carried out to investigate the long-term effects of macrophyte decomposition on the nutrient budget of a hypothetical lake. Results show that phosphorus released in the decomposition process of macrophytes in the lake can be reduced signiﬁcantly, at least by 75\%, if the above-ground macrophyte biomass is harvested at the end of the growing season.

We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivativefree optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to ﬁnd near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and reﬁne a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We ﬁnd that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of reﬁning a nearoptimal solution.},

	abstract = {The need for predictive process-oriented planktonic ecosystem models is widely recognized by the aquatic science community. We conducted a meta-analysis of recent mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical models (153 studies published from 1990 to 2002), to assess their ability to predict spatial and temporal patterns in the physical, chemical and biological dynamics of planktonic systems. The selected modeling studies covered a wide range of model complexity, ecosystem-types, spatio-temporal scales and purposes for model development. Despite the heterogeneous nature of this data set, we were able to identify model behavior trends and illuminate aspects of current modeling practice that need to be reevaluated. Temperature and dissolved oxygen had the highest coefficients of determination (respective median r2 values were 0.93 and 0.70) and the lowest relative error (median RE {\textless} 10\%), nutrients and phytoplankton had intermediate predictability (median r2 values ranging from 0.40 to 0.60 and median RE {\textasciitilde} 40\%), whereas bacteria (median r2 = 0.06) and zooplankton (median RE = 70\%) dynamics were poorly predicted. Longer simulation periods (i.e. months to decades) reduced model predictability, and increased model complexity did not improve fit. Aquatic biogeochemical modelers need to be more consistent in how they apply conventional methodological steps during model development (i.e. sensitivity analysis, validation), and the aquatic modeling community should adopt generally accepted standards of model performance. Recent advancements in data assimilation techniques, the combination of the present family of models with goal functions (derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the development of models with a stronger physiological basis are promising frameworks for obtaining more accurate simulations of planktonic processes.},

	abstract = {Complex environmental models are often criticized as being difﬁcult to analyze and poorly identiﬁable due to their nonlinearities and/or their large number of parameters relative to data availability. Others consider overparameterized models to be useful, especially for predicting system dynamics beyond the conditions for which the model was calibrated. In this paper, we present a complex eutrophication model that has been developed to simulate plankton dynamics in Lake Washington, USA. Because this model is to be used for testing alternative managerial schemes, the inclusion of multiple elemental cycles (org. C, N, P, Si, O) and multiple functional phytoplankton (diatoms, green algae and cyanobacteria) and zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) groups was deemed necessary. The model also takes into account recent advances in stoichiometric nutrient recycling theory, and the zooplankton grazing term was reformulated to include algal food quality effects on zooplankton assimilation efﬁciency. The physical structure of the model is simple and consists of two spatial compartments representing the lake epilimnion and hypolimnion. Global sensitivity analysis showed background light attenuation, the maximum phytoplankton growth rate, the phytoplankton basal metabolic rate, the zooplankton maximum grazing rate and the grazing half saturation constant have the greatest impact on model behavior. Phytoplankton phosphorus stoichiometry (maximum and minimum internal concentrations, maximum uptake rate) interacts with these parameters and determines the plankton dynamics (epilimnetic and hypolimnetic phytoplankton biomass, proportion of cyanobacteria and total zooplankton biomass). Sensitivity analysis of the model forcing functions indicated the importance of both external and internal loading for simulating epilimnetic and hypolimnetic plankton dynamics. These results will be used to calibrate the model, to reproduce present chemical and biological properties of Lake Washington and to test this lake’s potential response to different external nutrient loading scenarios.},

For the Sacramento River, we review existing climate data and research on impacts and describe the progress in implementing various adaptation strategies. We ﬁnd that the Durance and Sacramento—while certainly at different scales—nonetheless share many characteristics, such as a highly variable climate and hydrology, and extensive hydromodiﬁcation and intense water competition, which will be affected by climate change. Although some issues and approaches to adaptation are unique to each region, at the same time, these two river basins are utilizing some similar strategies to cope with a changing climate, such as regional planning and management and water conservation.},

All biomass types were affected by PAR and DOX, with anammox being the most sensitive bacteria. DOX inhibited more the biomass treating high strength nitrogenous efﬂuents (HSNE) than low strength nitrogenous efﬂuents (LSNE). The phosphorus uptake inhibition under anoxic conditions was lower than 25\% in the presence of PAR up to 400 mg LÀ1. The same DOX concentration inhibited anoxic phosphorus uptake more than 65\% for biomass treating LSNE and HSNE. Heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria seem to be more robust at high DOX and PAR concentrations than anammox.

Sediment samples from 40 sites of 3 estuaries of Cantabria (Spain) were classified with respect to 13 physical, chemical and toxicological variables using the SOM. Results obtained with the SOM, when compared to those of traditional multivariate statistical techniques commonly used in the field of sediment quality (principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)), provided a more useful classification for further assessment steps. Especially, the powerful visualization tools of the SOM, which offer more information and in an easier way than HCA and PCA, facilitate the task of establishing an order of priority between the distinguished groups of sites depending on their need for further investigations or remediation actions in subsequent management steps.},

	abstract = {Background: During the last decades the frequency and global distribution of toxic cyanobacteria blooms has increased globally, which has been attributed to the eutrophication and climate change. In Chile there have been reports on blooms in aquatic ecosystem in localities with high density population and on the presence of five congeners of microcystins but only two documented toxics blooms with hundreds fish kills. We investigated the presence of toxic cyanobacteria blooms in the Lo Galindo urban lake, Concepción city, and the environmental factors that influence the abundance of cyanobacteria and microcystins concentration. Lo Galindo Lake, is used for various recreational and eventually as a drinking water source.
Results: Toxic blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa are developed in Lo Galindo lake, those that occur throughout the year in a wide range of environmental conditions, forming scums blooms during summer and dispersive blooms in all seasons. There are different microcystin congeners, the most frequent congener was MC-RR (21 \%) and the highest concentration corresponded to 115.4 µg L-1 MC-LR.
Conclusions: The dominance and development of the M. aeruginosa blooms in the lake is determined by various environmental factors such as temperature, nutrients, diversity of taxa and wind speed that affect the formation of disperse-type blooms and/or scums; the latter are developed only in summer, coinciding with the highest temperature and concentrations of total microcystins. In the lake the microcystin and different types of congener is highly variable, so special care is recommended to use lake water for consumption and for recreational activities. The emergence and persistence of Microcystis blooms in this body of water are considered a potential health risk for the inhabitants of the area, considering the proximity and the system use by the inhabitants.},

We identified the key response variables within a lake that act as indicators of the effects of climate change on both the lake and the catchment. These variables reflect a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological responses to climate. However, the efficacy of the different indicators is affected by regional response to climate change, characteristics of the catchment, and lake mixing regimes. Thus, particular indicators or combinations of indicators are more effective for different lake types and geographic regions. The extraction of climate signals can be further complicated by the influence of other environmental changes, such as eutrophication or acidification, and the equivalent reverse phenomena, in addition to other land-use influences. In many cases, however, confounding factors can be addressed through analytical tools such as detrending or filtering. Lakes are effective sentinels for climate change because they are sensitive to climate, respond rapidly to change, and integrate information about changes in the catchment.},

In both approaches, single and multi-response, efﬁciency criteria are commonly used by hydrologists to provide an objective assessment of the “closeness” of the simulated behaviour to the observed measurements. While there are a few efﬁciency criteria such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency, coefﬁcient of determination, and index of agreement that are frequently used in hydrologic modeling studies and reported in the literature, there are a large number of other efﬁciency criteria to choose from. The selection and use of speciﬁc efﬁciency criteria and the interpretation of the results can be a challenge for even the most experienced hydrologist since each criterion may place different emphasis on different types of simulated and observed behaviours.

	abstract = {Light and dark bottle experiments, carried out in three systems in the Netherlands, were used to estimate the parameters of models relating the oxygen production rate to incident light intensity. The maximum production rate (PM) and the light saturation constant (/s) were estimated using both gross and nett oxygen production data. In the latter case, the community oxygen consumption rate (Rox) was also estimated. Eight models were compared with respect to goodness of fit, as has been accomplished previously by Jassby and Platt (Limnol. Oceanogr, 21, 540-547, 1976) and many others. This study, however, emphasizes the problem of parameter correlation and the consequential usefulness of these type of experiments to identify the PII curve parameters. The results show that at a 90\% level of confidence, the models cannot be distinguished with respect to goodness of fit. However, the models do show distinct differences in parameter correlation. Parameter correlation was shown to be related to the shape of the curve. P/I curves with high convexity were shown to be less sensitive for parameter correlation. In particular, models showing low convexity suffer from overparameterization, which means that on the basis of the observed production rates it is difficult to discriminate between the parameters. Also, alternative model formulations, using PM and the initial slope (a), were investigated. These formulations produced less parameter correlation. However, for models with low convexity, showing high parameter correlation anyway, the reduction is limited. The use of nett oxygen production data does not show a significant difference in fit at a 90\% confidence level. However, measured Ro\% from dark bottle experiments tends to be higher than the values found by estimating Rox from nett oxygen production.},

Four traps were set, at 50, 100, 300, 600 m depths on the mooring in 645 m deep water in the Lacaze-Duthier canyon. The total metal concentrations were determined by ICP-MS. Results show that Rb and SC contents display typical shale values. As, Cd, Pb, Sb, Zn, (normalized to SC) display high enrichment factors (up to 50) over shale compositions. Distinctive temporal variability as well as the respective contributions of local (Tct, Aude) and remote (RhBne) rivers and Sahara-derived aerosols have been identified. Fluxes of most elements observed in the upper 100 m can be attributed to atmospheric fluxes. In the deepest traps (300 and 600 m) these fluxes are, however, mostly dominated by riverine particles advected from the continental shelf. Most of the trace-element enrichments are more likely to be related to the anthropogenic input, rather than to biological cycling. Isotopic composition of lead determined by ICPMS enabled to evaluate that the proportion of anthropogenic lead derived from European gasoline consumption ranged between 50 and 100\%.},

It combines a buoyancy-extended {k-\textepsilon} model with a seiche excitation and damping model to predict the diffusivity below the surface mixed layer. The model was applied to predict the seasonal development of temperature stratification and turbulent diffusivity in two medium-sized lakes over time periods ranging from 3 weeks to 2 years. Depending on the type of boundary condition for temperature, two or three model parameters were optimized to calibrate the model. The agreement between the simulated and the observed temperature distributions is excellent, in particular, if lake surface temperatures were prescribed as surface boundary condition instead of temperature gradients derived from heat fluxes. Comparison of different model variants revealed that inclusion of horizontal pressure gradients and/or stability functions is not required to provide good agreement between model results and data. With the aid of uncertainty analysis it is shown that the depth of the mixed surface layer during the stratified period could be predicted accurately within ±1 m. The sensitivity of the model to several parameters is discussed.},

We review the response to temperature primarily from literature on fishes in terms of ecological concepts related to niche theory and competition. The width of the fundamental thermal niche is about 4°C when measured by a mean plus and minus one standard deviation of the distribution of temperature occupied in a laboratory gradient. Fish of temperate freshwater appear to fall into three thermal guilds along the temperature resource axis —cold, cool, and warm water fishes. Realized thermal niches are similar in central tendency to fundamental niches, but niche width appears to be more narrow for the realized niche in limited sample data. The success of interference competition for space with preferred temperature is tied to social dominance in a manner analogous to food competition. Thermal niche shifts in the face of interspecific competition for preferred temperature appear supported by one laboratory study. Exploitation competition in respect to temperature seems nebulous. If animals successfully compete for their thermal niche, growth and perhaps other measures of fitness are maximized. Cost/benefit models for thermal resources and food resources lead to similar predictions about resource use. We suggest that viewing temperature and other niche axes in the way ecologists have viewed food resources would be useful.}",

    abstract = {Characteristics of lake ecosystems often can be modeled quantitatively. Modeling is useful in predicting effects of human actions, the success of environmental remediation, or specific ecosystem variables of economic interest such as fish production. In addition, models promote an understanding of the interaction among numerous variables that determine the nature of lake ecosystems. Modeling requires the use of coupled equations that realistically represent relationships between controlling variables and ecosystem characteristics. Controlling variables may be specific to individual lakes (e.g., mean depth, water residence time) or they may be generic in that they are representative of most lakes (e.g., sedimentation rates governing deposition of particles onto the sediment surface). Experience shows that use of generic variables, which do not require collection of site-specific data, is satisfactory for many of the variables that must be included in the lake ecosystem models. Because the processes that occur within ecosystems are very numerous, the main challenge of successful ecosystem modeling is to design a model that is both simple and realistic. A typically successful strategy is to locate key variables that have important effects, and to omit many variables that have only minor effects. The creation of a model that makes unbiased predictions is achieved by the process of calibration, which involves the adjustment of key variables as necessary as to minimize bias. The calibration process may produce erroneous outcomes if the wrong variables are inadvertently adjusted. Modelers can detect and correct this type of error by validation, which involves testing of the model on lakes that were not part of the calibration process. If the model performs well during validation, it is likely that the calibration adjustments were made correctly; if not, recalibration is necessary. Scales of time and space are important in structuring and interpreting modeling. Models of lake ecosystems are most successful at making valid predictions over intermediate scales of time (months or years), rather than at very short time scale (days) or very long time scales (decades). One very important class of the lake ecosystem models uses information on the mass balance of nutrients or toxins to produce predictions about biologically controlled indicators such as amount of phytoplankton growth or transparency (which is affected by abundance of algal cells in the water). The predicted variables in this case are called ‘bioindicators.’ The mass-balance (abiotic) side of the model typically is represented by differential equations that take advantage of the law of conservation of mass. Bioindicators, on the other hand, are typically modeled with the help of regression relationships that are developed from field data on multiple lakes. An example would be the well-known correlation of chlorophyll a concentration (representing phytoplankton abundance) with the concentration of phosphorus, a key plant nutrient. Models that combine mass balance with bioindicators can be called ‘effect-load-sensitivity’ models. An especially important class of these models deals with the effects of nutrient enrichment on lakes (eutrophication). Food-web models are also especially important for lakes. Often the key to success in food-web modeling is an accurate representation of the top predators, which strongly influence the structure of the food web at lower trophic levels. Through detailed studies of the movement of radiocesium originating from the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radiocesium over Scandinavia and northern Europe, the accuracy and simplicity of mass-balance modeling has been greatly improved and simplified, bringing lake modeling to a level of application that can become part of university coursework or used by government agencies in lake management or planning.}
