## Overview

This documentation describes the current version 0.1a of 1D-AEMpy, which includes hydrodynamic calculations coupled to a functional aquatic ecosystem model that explicitly simulates dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton biomass, a nutrient concentration (simulating reactive phosphorus), labile particulate organic carbon (POC-l), labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC-l), refractory particulate organic carbon (POC-r), and refractory dissolved organic carbon (DOC-r). The coupling between both models depends primarily on the light extinction coefficient (function of the sum of organic carbon concentrations) to the heat attenuation of the water column, as well as the derived eddy diffusivity governing the vertical diffusion of dissolved water quality variables.

:::{.callout-note}
Version 0.1a differs to v0.1 in a set of important aspects:

-   v0.1 only simulates POC-l, DOC-l, POC-r, and DOC-r for water quality (meaning it essentially only captures the main metabolism reactions)
-   this means that in v0.1, GPP is a not dependent on any other state variable, but only on environmental conditions (light, nutrients)
-   v0.1 uses a time-dependent boundary condition for the internal availability of nutrients, i.e., TP
-   v0.1 does not include external mass fluxes, e.g., for POC-r and POC-l
:::


1D-AEMpy iteratively runs 8 modules to update the states of a set of model variables.

## Hydrodynamics

A one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model was developed to simulate the temperature, heat flux and stratification dynamics in a lake. The algorithms are based on the eddy diffusion approach \textit{sensu} (@{henderson-sellers_new_1985}) and the MyLake (@{saloranta_mylakemulti-year_2007}) model. Using the one-dimensional temperature diffusion equation for heat transport, we neglected any inflows and outflows, mass losses due to evaporation and water level changes:
$$
    \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}=0
$$

$$
    A \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(A K_z \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}) + \frac{1}{{\rho_w c_p}}\frac{\partial H(z)}{\partial z}  + \frac{\partial A}{\partial z}\frac{H_{geo}}{\rho_w c_p}
$$

where $h$ is the water level (m), $A$ is lake area (m<sup>2</sup>), $T$ is water temperature (\textdegree C), $t$ is time (s), $K_z$ is the vertical diffusion coefficient m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, $H$ is internal heat generation due to incoming solar radiation (W m<sup>2</sup>), $\rho_w$ is water density (kg m<sup>-3</sup>), $c_p$ is specific heat content of water (J kg<sup>-1</sup> \textdegree C<sup>-1</sup>), and $H_{geo}$ is internal geothermal heat generation (W m<sup>-2</sup>) (which was set to 0.1 W m<sup>-2</sup> (@goudsmit_application_2002_epsilon)). Internal heat generation is implemented based on Beer-Lambert law for attenuation of short-wave radiation as a function of a constant light attenuation coefficient:
$$
    H(z)=\left(1-\alpha\right)I_s \text{exp}\left(-k_d z\right)
$$
where $\alpha$ is the albedo ($-$), $I_s$ is total incident short-wave radiation (W m<sup>-2</sup>), and $k_d$ is a light attenuation coefficient (m<sup>-1</sup>).
For the boundary conditions, we assume a Neumann type for the temperature diffusion equation at the atmosphere-surface boundary, and a zero-flux Neumann type at the bottom:
$$
    \rho_w c_p(K_z \frac{\partial T}{\partial z})_{surface}=H_{net}
$$
$$
    K_z (\frac{\partial T}{\partial z})_{bottom}=0
$$
where $H_{net}$ is the net heat flux exchange between atmosphere and water column (W m<sup>-2</sup>). The neat heat flux exchange consisted of four terms: 
$$
    H_{net}=H_{lw}+H_{lwr}+H_v+H_c
$$
where $H_{lw}$ is the incoming long-wave radiation (W m<sup>-2</sup>), $H_{lwr}$ is emitted radiation from the water column (W m<sup>-2</sup>), $H_v$ is the latent heat flux (W m<sup>-2</sup>), and $H_c$ is the sensible heat flux (W m<sup>-2</sup>). Incoming and outgoing long-wave heat fluxes were derived using the formulations from @livingstone_annual_1989 and @goudsmit_application_2002_epsilon. The latent and sensible heat fluxes were calculated taking into account atmospheric stability using the algorithm by @verburg_persistent_2010.

The calculation of a temperature profile at every time step is modularized into four steps: (a) heat generation from boundary conditions, (b) ice and snow formation,
(c) vertical diffusion, (d) wind-induced mixing, and (e) convective overturn. The one-dimensional temperature diffusion equation was discretized using the implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme (@press_numericalrecipes), which being second-order in both space and time allows the modeling time step to be dynamic without numerical stability issues. The model was implemented in Python 3.7 with a default time step of $\Delta t = 3,600$ s and a default spatial discretization of $\Delta z = 0.5$ m.

### a) Heat generation from boundary conditions 
In the first step, the heat fluxes $H$, $H_{geo}$ and $H_{net}$ are applied over the vertical water column. 


### b) Ice, snow, and snow ice formation
In the second step, the ice and snow cover algorithm from MyLake @(saloranta_mylakemulti-year_2007) was applied to the model.
Whenever water temperatures were equal or below the freezing point of water (set to 0 \textdegree C), ice formation was triggered. All layers with water temperatures below the freezing point were set to 0 \textdegree C, and the heat deficit from atmospheric heat exchange was converted into latent heat of ice formation. Stefan's law was applied to calculate ice thickness when air temperatures were below freezing point triggering ice formation (e.g., @lepparanta_review_1993):
$$
     h_{ice}=\sqrt{h_{ice}^2+\frac{2 \kappa_{ice}}{\rho_{ice}L}(T_f-T_{ice})\Delta t}
$$
where $h_{ice}$ is ice thickness ($m$), $\kappa_{ice}$ is thermal conductivity of ice ($W$ $K^{-1}$ $m^{-1}$), $\rho_{ice}$ is ice density ($kg$ $m^{-3}$), $L$ is latent heat of freezing ($J$ $kg^{-1}$), $T_f$ is water temperature at freezing point ($T_f =$ 0 $^\circ C$), and $T_{ice}$ is the temperature of the ice surface. 
The formation of a snow layer on top of the ice layer depended on the amount of precipitation. Further, whenever the weight of snow exceeded the buoyancy capacity of the ice layer, enough water to offset the exceedance forms a snow ice layer with the same properties as ice.
When air temperatures were above the freezing point, ice and snow growth ceased, and snow and ice melting were initiated with ice melt requiring no snow to exist. Here, total energy of melting was taken from the total heat flux $H_{net}$. Once the ice layer has disappeared, the default model routine continued. For more details, we refer the reader to @{saloranta_mylakemulti-year_2007}.


### c) Vertical (turbulent) diffusion 
In the third step, vertical turbulent diffusion between adjacent grid cells was calculated. Here, we applied a centered difference approximation for temperature at the next time step. The vertical turbulent
diffusion coefficients, $K_t$, were calculated using an empirical relationship depending on the Richardson number:
$$
    K_z = \frac{K_0}{(1+5 Ri(z))^2} + K_m
$$
where $K_0$ is an adjustable parameter (set to $10^{-2}$ m s<sup>-2</sup>) $R_i$ is the Richardson number, and $K_m$ is the background eddy diffusivity (@pacanowski_paramterization_1981, @jabbari_nearshore_2023). The Richardson number was quantified as:
$$
    R_i= \frac{-1 + [1+ 40 N^2 k^2 z^2 / \left({w^*}^2 \text{exp}(-2 k^* z)\right)]^{(1/2)}}{20}
$$
with $k$ as the Karman constant ($k=0.4$), and the squared buoyancy frequency, $N^2=\frac{g}{\rho_w}\frac{\partial \rho_w}{\partial z}$ ($s^{-2}$) (@henderson-sellers_new_1985). Friction velocity $w^*$ was calculated as:
$$
    w^*= C_D U_2 
$$
where the drag coefficient $C_D$ was set to $1.3$ x $10^{-3}$, and $U_2$ is the wind speed at 2 m above surface (m s<sup>-1</sup>).  All values of $N^2$ less than $7.0$ x $10^{-5}$ s<sup>-2</sup> were set to $7.0$ x $10^{-5}$ s<sup>-2</sup> (@hondzo_lake_1993). 

To replicate a lag in the mixing dynamics, we set the values of $K_z$ to the average between the current profile and the one from the previous time step (@piccolroaz_deep_2013).  

#### Numerical implementation
The implicit Crnak-Nicolson scheme, whichis second-order derivative in space and time, was applied to solve the one-dimensional temperature transport equation for the diffusive transport. Here, we average the response in space between the current and the next time step:
$$
A \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=A K_z \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
$$
$$
A \frac{T_i^{n+1} - T_i^n}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2} [A K_z \frac{T_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2 T_i^{n+1} + T_{i-1}^{n+1}}{\Delta z^2} +  A K_z \frac{T_{i+1}^{n} - 2 T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n}{\Delta z^2}]
$$
Here, we can apply $\alpha = A K_z \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta z^2}$, transforming the equation to:
$$
- \frac{\alpha}{2} T_{i+1}^{n+1} + (A+\alpha)T_{i}^{n+1}- \frac{\alpha}{2}T_{i-1}^{n+1} =\frac{\alpha}{2} T_{i+1}^{n} + (A-\alpha)T_{i}^{n}+ \frac{\alpha}{2}T_{i-1}^{n}
$$
$$
- \frac{\alpha}{2} T_{i+1}^{n+1} + (A+\alpha)T_{i}^{n+1}- \frac{\alpha}{2}T_{i-1}^{n+1} = R_i^n
$$
where the right-hand side quantity $R_i^n$ is known at the beginning of each time step.

In the current version, we asusme static Dirichlet boundary conditions for the diffusive transport, which transforms the equation into a matrix (given here for an example for 5 times 5 rows and columns):
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &0 \\
- \frac{\alpha}{2} & 1+\alpha & - \frac{\alpha}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 &- \frac{\alpha}{2} & 1+\alpha & - \frac{\alpha}{2} & 0  \\
0 & 0 &- \frac{\alpha}{2} & 1+\alpha & - \frac{\alpha}{2} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} T_1^{n+1} \\  
T_2^{n+1} \\ 
 T_3^{n+1} \\ 
  T_4^{n+1} \\ 
   T_5^{n+1} 
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} T_1^n \\  
R_2^n \\ 
 R_3^n \\ 
  R_4^n \\ 
   T_5^n
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

### d) Wind-induced mixing 
To ensure an adequate representation of the effects of wind-induced mixing, which was not incorporated into the turbulent diffusive transport step, an additional step based on the concept of integral energy was applied following the algorithms by @saloranta_mylakemulti-year_2007 and @ford_thermal_1980. Generally, the avaible
external turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is compared to the potential energy of the water column
that is needed to lift up denser water from below a mixed
layer into a newly formed mixed layer until the external TKE is depleted. TKE was quantified as:
$$
TKE = C_{shelter} A_s \sqrt{\frac{\tau^3}{\rho_w}} \Delta t
$$
where $C_{shelter}$ is a wind-sheltering coefficient, and $\tau$ is the wind shear stress. $C_{shelter}$  was parameterized based on @hondzo_lake_1993:
$$
C_{shelter} = 1.0 - exp(-0.3 A_s)
$$
TKE is compared with the available potential energy (PE) in the water column:
$$
PE = g \Delta \rho_w \frac{V_{mixed} V_z}{V_{mixed} + V_z} (z_{mixed} +\Delta z_{M, z} - z_{M, mixed})
$$
where $\Delta \rho_w$ is the density difference between layer $z$ and the mixed-layer (epilimnion) density, $V_{mixed}$ is the mixed-layer volume, and $\Delta z_{M, z}$ is the distance from layer $z$'s center of mass, $z_M$, to the bottom of the mixed-layer. 

If TKE $\geq$ PE, then layer $z$ will be mixed into the mixed layer (the epilimnion). This also includes water quality variables, which will be volume-averaged. Once TKE $<$ PE, the remaining energy will be used for partial mixing as in @saloranta_mylakemulti-year_2007.


### e) Convective overturn 
In the final step, any density instabilities over the vertical water column were mixed with the first stable
layer below an unstable layer. Here, we applied the area weighed mean of temperature between two layers to calculate the new temperature of the previously unstable grid cell. Density differences between two layers were averaged until the difference was equal or less than $1$ x $10^{-3}$ kg m<sup>-3</sup>. {An arbitrary cutoff of $1$ x $10^{-3}$ kg m<sup>-3</sup> was chosen to reduce computational run time by preventing averaging of density profiles to the fourth decimal point.}


## Water quality

The current implementation simulates dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton biomass, a nutrient concentration (simulating reactive phosphorus), labile particulate organic carbon (POC-l), labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC-l), refractory particulate organic carbon (POC-r), and refractory dissolved organic carbon (DOC-r) following a general equation of:
$$
A \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + w \frac{\partial C}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(A K_z \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}) = P(C) - D(C)
$$
where $w$ is a sinking rate, $P(C)$ is a production term, and $D(C)$ is a consumption (destruction) term.

The main feedback of water quality to hydrodynamics is via the light extinction coefficient:

$$
k_d = k_{d, water} + k_{d, DOC} \overline{C_{DOC}} +  k_{d, POC} \overline{C_{POC}}
$$
where there are specific light extinction coefficients for background water, DOC and POC, $k_{d, water}$, $k_{d, DOC}$ and $k_{d, POC}$, respectively, as well as the average sum of DOC and POC concentrations, $\overline{C_{DOC}}$ and $\overline{C_{POC}}$, respectively, from the surface to the mean depth of the lake.

The water quality simulation is split into three modules dealing with (f) effects of external and internal boundaries, (g) internal production and conumption pathways, and (h) vertical transport.

### f) Boundary fluxes

Boundary fluxes include mass addition from external loadings, gas-exchange between the atmosphere and the water column, as well as sediment consumption fluxes.

For mass fluxes, external loadings in m s<sup>-1</sup> are added directly to the layer adjacent to the atmosphere-water interface and are multiplied with the time step.

Surface gas exchange for dissolved oxygen was parameterized as
$$
F_{atm} = k_{p} (C_{DO, atm} - C_{DO}) A \Delta t
$$
where $k_{p}$ is the piston velocity, and $C_{DO, atm}$ is the saturated oxygen concentration. The piston velocity was calculated using the empirical gas exchange model following @vachon_ecosystem_2013 based on lake area and wind velocity.

Sediment oxygen demand for the consumption of the dissolved oxygen conentration $C_{DO}$ (a sink for oxygen in the model) is quantified as
$$
SOD = (F_{DO}  + \frac{D_{diff}}{\delta} C_{DO} A ) \theta_{R}^{T-20} \Delta t
$$
where $F_{DO}$ is an idealized area flux rate (g m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), $D_{diff}$ is the molecular oxygen diffusion coefficient (m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), $\delta$ is the thickness of the sediment diffusive boundary layer (m, set to a constant value of 0.001 m ), and $\theta$ is a temperature multiplier, here for respiration $R$. $D_{diff}$ was quantified as a function of water temperature following @han_oxygen_1996. 

The release of nutrients from the sediment, $SNR$ (a source of nutrients in the model), was parameterized as a function depending on dissolved oxygen availability (using Michaelis-Menten kinetics) and temperature:
$$
SNR = (F_{NUTR} \frac{C_{DO}}{k_{DO} + C_{DO}} A)\theta_{R}^{T-20} \Delta t
$$
where $F_{NUTR}$ is an idealized area flux rate (g m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), and $k_{DO}$ is the half-saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen (g m<sup>-3</sup>).

:::{.callout-note}
In v0.1, SOD is quantified using Michaelis-Menten kinetics:
$$
SOD = (F_{DO} \frac{C_{DO}}{k_{DO} + C_{DO}} A)\theta_{R}^{T-20} \Delta t
$$

Furter, GPP is quantified as a direct addition to oxygen, POC-l, and DOC-l at every time step using a forward Euler scheme:

$$
GPP = R_{molar} (H p_1 I_P C_{nutr} \theta_{GPP}^{T-20})
$$
where $R_{molar}$ is the respective molar ratio to convert from carbon units into something else, $p_1$ is the conversion from short-wave radiation to PAR (2.114), and $I_P$ is a calibration coeffcient.

$$
M_{DO}^{t} = M_{DO}^{t-1} + \Delta t * GPP 
$$
$$
M_{POC-l}^{t} = M_{POC-l}^{t-1} + 0.2 \Delta t * GPP 
$$
$$
M_{DOC-l}^{t} = M_{DOC-l}^{t-1} + 0.8 \Delta t * GPP 
$$

:::

### g) Production and consumption

The model tracks the mass dynamics of dissolved oxygen, $M_{DO}$, phytoplankton biomass, $M_{phyto}$, nutrients, $M_{nutr}$, labile particulate organic carbon, $M_{POC-l}$, labile dissolved organic carbon, $M_{DOC-l}$, refractory particulate organic carbon, $M_{POR-r}$, and refractory dissolved organic carbon, $M_{POC-l}$. The respective concentrations, $C$ were quantified by dividing the masses with the voume. 

For production terms, gross primary production was quantified as
$$
GPP = M_{phyto} R_{molar} (H p_1 I_P C_{nutr} \theta_{GPP}^{T-20})
$$
where $R_{molar}$ is the respective molar ratio to convert from carbon units into something else, $p_1$ is the conversion from short-wave radiation to PAR (2.114), and $I_P$ is a calibration coeffcient.

Respiration was quantified as depending on oxygen availability
$$
RSP = M_{i} R_{molar} R_i \frac{C_{DO}}{k_{DO} + C_{DO}} \theta_{R}^{T-20}
$$
with $M_{i}$ either being nutrient, POC-l, DOC-l, POC-r, or DOC-r, and $R_i$ is the respective respiration rate.

Phytoplankton growth was quantified similar to GPP
$$
G = p_2 H p_1 \frac{C_{phyto}}{k_{phyto} + C_{phyto}} \theta_{GPP}^{T-20}
$$
with $p_2$ being the growth rate of algae (d<sup>-1</sup>).

The respective production and consumption terms for each variable are listed below:

$$
P_{DO} - D_{DO} = GPP - (RSP_{POC-l} + RSP_{DOC-l} + RSP_{POC-r} + RSP_{DOC-r} + RSP_{nutr})
$$
$$
P_{POC-l} - D_{POC-l} = 0.8 GPP - RSP_{POC-l} 
$$
$$
P_{DOC-l} - D_{DOC-l} = (RSP_{POC-l} + 0.2 GPP) - RSP_{DOC-r} 
$$
$$
P_{POC-r} - D_{POC-r} =  - RSP_{POC-r} 
$$
$$
P_{DOC-r} - D_{DOC-r} = RSP_{POC-r} - RSP_{DOC-r} 
$$

$$
P_{phyto} - D_{phyto} = G M_{phyto} - p_3 M_{phyto}  \theta_{GPP}^{T-20}
$$
with $p_3$ as a grazing rate (d<sup>-1</sup>).
$$
P_{nutr} - D_{nutr} = p_3 p_4 M_{phyto} R_{molar}  \theta_{GPP}^{T-20} - RSP_{nutr}
$$
with $p_4$ as the grazing ratio (hence, how much of the grazed material is converted from the grazer into nutrients, similar to an excretion rate).

:::{.callout-note}
In v0.1, no production terms are used as GPP is included in the boundary flux module. Therefore, the following consumption terms are used:
$$
P_{DO} - D_{DO} = - (RSP_{POC-l} + RSP_{DOC-l} + RSP_{POC-r} + RSP_{DOC-r})
$$
$$
P_{POC-l} - D_{POC-l} = - RSP_{POC-l} 
$$
$$
P_{DOC-l} - D_{DOC-l} = - RSP_{DOC-r} 
$$
$$
P_{POC-r} - D_{POC-r} =  - RSP_{POC-r} 
$$
$$
P_{DOC-r} - D_{DOC-r} =  - RSP_{DOC-r} 
$$
:::

#### Numerical implementation
For internal production and consumption fluxes, we applied the 2nd-order Modified Patankar-Runge-Kutta scheme, which is mass conservative and unconditionally positive (@burchard_patankar_2003):
$$
C_i^{(1)}=C_i^n + \Delta t(\sum_{j=1}^I P_{i,j}(C^n) - \sum_{j=1}^I D_{i,j}(C^n) \frac{C_i^{(1)}}{C_i^n})
$$
$$
C_i^{n+1} = C_i^n + \frac{\Delta t}{2} (\sum_{j=1}^I (P_{i,j}(C^n) + p_{i,j}(C^{(1)})) \frac{C_j^{n+1}}{C_j^{(1)}} - \sum_{j=1}^I (D_{i,j}(C^n) + D_{i,j}(C^{(1)})) \frac{C_j^{n+1}}{C_j^{(1)}})
$$
$$
\text{with } i = 1, ..., I
$$
where $i$ determines the current water quality constituent, $P$ is a source term, and $D$ is a sink term.

### h) Transport

For vertical transport, sinking and diffusion were parameterized for particulate and dissolved substances, respectively. For phytoplankton biomass, sinking and diffusion were both applied.

Sinking was conceptualized as a sinking loss that was applied to every cell:
$$
SL = M_i \frac{v_{i,settling}}{\Delta z} \Delta t
$$
with $v_{i,settling}$ as a constant settling velocity. Similarily, a constant sedimentation rate, $v_{sedimentation}$ was applied to the grid cell adjacent to the sediment-water interface to remove mass from the model over time.

Turbulent diffusion was applied to the dissolved substances according to the previously described scheme in (c).
